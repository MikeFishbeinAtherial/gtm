# Implementation Progress

Last updated: December 20, 2024

---

## ✅ Completed Today

### 1. **Cleaned Up Commands**
- ✅ Deleted `/offer-icp` command (redundant)
- ✅ Updated positioning canvas to include ICP as Section 2
- ✅ Clarified: ICP = stable attributes, Signals = observable behaviors

### 2. **Updated Positioning Canvas Framework**
New structure:
```
1. Category Definition
2. Target Customer (ICP) ← NEW SECTION
   - Company Profile (size, industry, geography)
   - Buyer Profile (titles, department, seniority)
3. Customer Problem
4. Observable Signals (hiring, tech, growth, events)
5. Benefits & Outcomes
6. Current Alternatives
7. One-Line Positioning
```

### 3. **Built First API Client: Exa**
- ✅ Full TypeScript client with error handling
- ✅ Helper functions:
  - `exaFindCompanies()` - Search by ICP
  - `exaResearchCompany()` - Deep dive on specific company
  - `exaIndustryResearch()` - Find trends for PVP creation
- ✅ Location: `src/lib/clients/exa.ts`

## 🎯 API Integration Strategy (Decided)

### **Use Direct API Calls** (Not MCP, Not Rube)

**Why:**
1. **MCP** - Great for Supabase, but no MCP servers exist for Parallel, Exa, TheirStack
2. **Rube** - Only covers productivity tools (Gmail, Slack), not data APIs
3. **Direct** - Full control, faster, works everywhere

**Architecture:**
```
Direct TypeScript Clients
├── Exa ✅ (done)
├── Parallel (next)
├── TheirStack (next)
├── Leadmagic (later)
└── Unipile (later)

MCP (where available)
└── Supabase ✅ (already working)
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### **Immediate: Build Parallel Client**

Parallel is the PRIMARY data source for:
- Company search (firmographics)
- People search (find decision makers)
- Enrichment (get contact details)

**File to create:** `src/lib/clients/parallel.ts`

**Functions needed:**
```typescript
- parallelSearchCompanies(icp) → Company[]
- parallelSearchPeople(company, titles) → Contact[]
- parallelEnrichCompany(domain) → CompanyDetails
- parallelEnrichContact(linkedin_url) → ContactDetails
```

### **Then: TheirStack Client**

For hiring signals (job postings).

**File to create:** `src/lib/clients/theirstack.ts`

**Functions needed:**
```typescript
- theirstackSearchJobs(params) → JobPosting[]
- theirstackGetCompanies(job_titles) → Company[]
```

### **Then: Build `/offer-launch` Command**

Orchestrates all APIs to find companies:

```
Input: Positioning canvas (ICP + signals)
↓
1. Exa: Broad company search
2. Parallel: Enrich companies + find people
3. TheirStack: Check hiring signals
4. Unipile: Check connection status
5. Save to Supabase
↓
Output: "Found 47 companies, 89 contacts"
```

## 🎓 What You Learned Today

### Commands vs. Context
- **Commands** = thin orchestration layer (what steps to take)
- **Context** = thick knowledge layer (how to think about it)
- Edit context → all commands automatically improve

### ICP vs. Signals
- **ICP** = WHO (stable: size, industry, buyer role)
- **Signals** = DOING WHAT (observable: hiring, funding, tech stack)
- Keep them separate but complementary

### API Integration
- **Direct APIs** for data enrichment (Parallel, Exa, TheirStack)
- **MCP** where available (Supabase)
- **Don't use Rube** for this use case (wrong tool types)

## ⏭️ Ready to Continue?

Want me to:
1. **Build Parallel client** (company/people search) - Most important next step
2. **Build TheirStack client** (hiring signals)
3. **Create `/offer-launch` command** (orchestrate discovery)
4. **Test `/new-offer` with your sales training app** (see it work end-to-end)

Which would you like to tackle next?
