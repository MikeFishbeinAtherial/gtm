It stitches together metadata from various sources (Snowflake, dbt, Databricks, Looker, Tableau, Postgres, etc.) to create a unified data discovery, cataloging, lineage, and governance experience across all your data assets, from columns and queries to metrics and dashboards. Atlan facilitates a two-way movement of metadata, bringing context back into the tools and workflows that your data team uses every day — for example, in your BI tool when you wonder what a metric on the dashboard means. A pioneer in the space, Atlan has been named a Visionary in the 2025 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Data and Analytics Governance Platforms and a Leader and the only Customer Favorite in The Forrester Wave™: Data Governance Solutions, Q3 2025. Atlan was also recognized by Gartner seven times in 2021, including as a Cool Vendor in DataOps and in the inaugural Market Guide for Active Metadata Management. Today, we power data democratization and AI-readiness at companies like General Motors, Cisco, Autodesk, Unilever, Ralph Lauren, FOX, News Corp, Nasdaq, NextGen, Plaid, and HubSpot.

While a recent fund closing was $1.4B, which is within the $100M-$2B mid-market range, other sources indicate firm-level AUM between $3.5B and $5.3B, exceeding the $2B upper bound.
