# Offer Management

## Folder Structure

Each offer lives in `offers/{offer-slug}/` with this structure:
- `README.md` - Overview and current status
- `positioning-canvas.md` - Positioning decisions
- `icp.md` - Ideal Customer Profile
- `copy/` - Email and LinkedIn templates
- `research/` - Market research and notes
- `results/` - Campaign results and learnings

## Creating New Offers

Use the `/new-offer` command. This will:
1. Create the folder structure from template
2. Guide you through positioning canvas
3. Generate initial ICP
4. Create draft copy

## Offer Statuses

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `positioning` | Working on positioning canvas |
| `researched` | Market research complete |
| `icp_defined` | ICP generated and saved |
| `copy_ready` | Email and LinkedIn copy generated |
| `campaign_active` | Outreach campaign running |
| `paused` | Campaign paused |
| `completed` | Campaign finished, results captured |
| `killed` | Offer abandoned |

## Context References

When working on an offer, always reference:
1. The offer's own files (positioning, ICP)
2. General frameworks from `context/frameworks/`
3. Relevant examples from `context/examples/`

## Updating Learnings

After each campaign, update:
1. `offers/{slug}/results/learnings.md` - What we learned
2. `context/learnings/what-works.md` - If broadly applicable

## Workflow

```
/new-offer           → Creates offer folder, positioning canvas
/offer-research      → Competitor and market research
/offer-icp           → Generate ICP from positioning
/offer-copy          → Generate email and LinkedIn copy
/offer-launch        → Find companies, contacts, prepare messages
[Manual sending]     → Send messages via LinkedIn/email
/offer-review        → Analyze results, capture learnings
```
