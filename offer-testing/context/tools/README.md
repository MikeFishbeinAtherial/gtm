# Tools (Index)

This project already has tool documentation in two places:

## 1) Detailed tool docs (canonical)

**Folder:** `offer-testing/context/api-tools/`

- Each tool has its own folder (e.g. `unipile/`, `parallel/`)
- Contains setup notes + examples

Start here:
- `offer-testing/context/api-tools/README.md`

## 2) Quick reference cards

**Folder:** `offer-testing/context/api-guides/`

Good “which tool should I use?” docs:
- `offer-testing/context/api-guides/api-comparison.md`
- `offer-testing/context/api-guides/README.md`
- `offer-testing/context/api-guides/parallel-quick-reference.md`
- `offer-testing/context/api-guides/exa-quick-reference.md`
- `offer-testing/context/api-guides/theirstack-quick-reference.md`

## Why we’re NOT renaming/moving right now

- Other docs/rules already reference `context/api-guides/*` and `context/api-tools/*`
- Renaming would create broken links + “context drift”

If you want a single folder later, we can do it as a deliberate refactor (with search/replace updates).
