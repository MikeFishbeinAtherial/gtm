# Positioning Canvas Framework

This framework helps you define clear positioning for any offer. Good positioning makes everything downstream better - ICP, signals, copy, and targeting.

---

## How to Use This Framework

1. **Don't rush it** - Spend 30-60 minutes on positioning before any outreach
2. **Be specific** - "Small businesses" is too vague. "B2B SaaS companies with 20-100 employees" is specific.
3. **Test your answers** - Can you find these companies? Can you detect these signals?
4. **Iterate** - Update positioning based on what you learn from outreach

---

## Structure Overview

```
1. Category Definition → What bucket do they file this in?
2. Target Customer (ICP) → WHO has the problem?
3. Problem → WHAT pain do they have?
4. Observable Signals → HOW do we find them?
5. Benefits & Outcomes → WHAT changes?
6. Current Alternatives → What are they using now?
7. One-Line Positioning → Your elevator pitch
```

## 1. Category Definition

**Why it matters:** The category tells prospects where to "file" your offer mentally. Pick the wrong category and they'll evaluate you against the wrong alternatives.

### Guidelines for Choosing Category

| Approach | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Create new category** | You're truly novel, have resources to educate | "AI Sales Coach" (if no one else calls themselves this) |
| **Reframe existing category** | Existing category has baggage | "Sales Training" → "Sales Practice Platform" |
| **Subcategory of known thing** | Want borrowed credibility | "Role-play training for sales teams" |
| **Alternative to known thing** | Direct replacement | "Gong alternative for smaller teams" |

### Fill In

| Field | Your Answer | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| Category name | | What would you call this on your website? |
| Category you're competing with | | What budget does this come from? |
| How you want to be different | | What makes you NOT just another [category]? |

---

## 2. Target Customer (ICP)

**Why it matters:** You need to know WHO to target before you can find them. Keep it simple - just the essentials for search.

### Guidelines for ICP Definition

**Good ICPs are:**
- **Specific enough to search** - "B2B SaaS companies" not just "tech companies"
- **Broad enough to scale** - 1,000+ companies minimum
- **Stable attributes** - Company size doesn't change weekly
- **Searchable** - You can find these in Parallel, Exa, etc.

**ICP = WHO they are (stable)**
- Company size, industry, geography, stage

**Signals = WHAT they're doing (observable)**
- Hiring, funding, tech stack changes (comes next section)

### Company Profile (Firmographics)

| Field | Your Answer | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Size** | | Employees (e.g., "20-100") |
| **Industry/Vertical** | | Be specific (e.g., "B2B SaaS" not "tech") |
| **Stage** | | Startup / Growth / Enterprise |
| **Geography** | | Countries or regions |
| **Revenue** (optional) | | ARR or annual revenue range |

### Buyer Profile

| Field | Your Answer | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Primary decision maker** | | Titles (e.g., "VP Sales, Head of Sales") |
| **Influencers** | | Who else is involved? |
| **Department** | | Which team? (Sales, Marketing, Ops) |
| **Seniority** | | C-level, VP, Director, Manager |

### Example: Sales Role Play Trainer

**Company Profile:**
- Size: 20-100 employees
- Industry: B2B SaaS, Software
- Stage: Series A/B (post-PMF, scaling)
- Geography: United States
- Revenue: $2-20M ARR

**Buyer Profile:**
- Primary: VP Sales, Head of Sales
- Influencers: Sales Manager, CRO, Sales Enablement
- Department: Sales, Revenue Ops
- Seniority: VP, Director

### Search Query Preview

**This ICP translates to:**
```
Exa: "B2B SaaS companies with 20-100 employees in United States"
Parallel: company_size:20-100 AND industry:software AND location:US
```

## 3. Customer Problem

**Why it matters:** You're not selling a product, you're solving a problem. The clearer the problem, the more urgency the prospect feels.

### Guidelines for Problem Definition

**Good problems are:**
- **Specific** - Not "sales is hard" but "new reps take 6+ months to ramp"
- **Costly** - Either money, time, or emotional pain
- **Frequent** - Happens often enough to be top-of-mind
- **Unsolved** - Current solutions have gaps

**Problem Hierarchy:**

```
LATENT PROBLEM (They have it but don't know it)
    ↓
PAIN POINT (They know it hurts)
    ↓
ACTIVE SEARCH (They're looking for solutions)
    ↓
DECISION MODE (They're ready to buy)
```

You can target any level, but copy changes dramatically.

### Fill In

| Field | Your Answer |
|-------|-------------|
| **Core problem in one sentence** | |
| **Who feels this problem most?** | (Title, not company) |
| **What happens if they don't solve it?** | (Business impact) |
| **How do they talk about this problem?** | (Their words, not yours) |
| **What level of awareness?** | Latent / Pain Point / Active Search / Decision Mode |

### Example: Sales Role Play Trainer

| Field | Answer |
|-------|--------|
| Core problem | New sales reps take 6+ months to hit quota because they don't get enough practice |
| Who feels it | VP Sales, Sales Managers, Sales Enablement |
| If not solved | Longer ramp time, missed revenue, rep turnover |
| How they talk about it | "Our reps aren't ready for live calls" / "We need more coaching bandwidth" |
| Awareness level | Pain Point (they know it hurts but may not be actively looking) |

---

## 4. Observable Signals (How to Find Them)

**Why it matters:** You can't see someone's "problem" directly, but you CAN see symptoms. These symptoms become your targeting signals.

### Guidelines for Finding Symptoms

Ask: "What would a company be DOING if they have this problem?"

| Symptom Type | Question to Ask | Example |
|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Hiring** | What roles do they hire when they have this problem? | Hiring SDRs = need to train them |
| **Buying** | What do they buy before/alongside this? | Bought Salesforce = has sales team |
| **Doing** | What activities indicate the problem? | Posting about "sales ramp time" |
| **Experiencing** | What events trigger the problem? | Just raised Series A = scaling sales |
| **Lacking** | What's missing that suggests the problem? | No sales enablement person = DIY training |

### Fill In

| Symptom Category | Observable Signal | Where to Detect It |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Hiring | | TheirStack, LinkedIn |
| Buying/Using | | BuiltWith, LinkedIn |
| Saying/Posting | | LinkedIn, Podcasts |
| Event/Trigger | | News, Crunchbase |
| Missing/Lacking | | Company analysis |

### Example: Sales Role Play Trainer

| Symptom | Signal | Detection |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Hiring | Posting SDR/BDR/AE jobs | TheirStack |
| Hiring | "Sales Manager" or "Sales Enablement" role | TheirStack |
| Using | Gong, Chorus, Outreach | BuiltWith/LinkedIn |
| Event | Just raised Series A/B | Crunchbase |
| Event | New VP Sales joined | LinkedIn |
| Lacking | No "Sales Enablement" on team | LinkedIn |

## 5. Benefits & Outcomes

**Why it matters:** Features describe what you do. Benefits describe what they GET. Outcomes describe what CHANGES.

### Guidelines for Benefits

| Level | Definition | Example |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Features** | What the product does | "AI-powered role play simulations" |
| **Benefits** | What the feature enables | "Reps practice before real calls" |
| **Outcomes** | What changes in their business | "Cut ramp time from 6 months to 3 months" |

**Always lead with outcomes** in outreach. Features come later.

### Outcome Categories

| Category | Question | Example Answer |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| **Time** | What takes less time? | Ramp 50% faster |
| **Money** | What costs less or earns more? | Each rep productive 3 months sooner = $150K+ |
| **Risk** | What's less risky? | Don't lose deals to unprepared reps |
| **Effort** | What's easier? | Managers coach without being on every call |
| **Quality** | What's better? | Reps handle objections consistently |

### Fill In

| Type | Outcome | Quantify If Possible |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| Immediate benefit | | (What happens in Week 1?) |
| Short-term outcome | | (What changes in 30-90 days?) |
| Long-term outcome | | (What's different in 6-12 months?) |
| Emotional benefit | | (How do they FEEL?) |

## 6. Current Alternatives

**Why it matters:** You're never competing against "nothing." Understanding alternatives helps you position against them.

### Fill In

| Alternative | Who Uses It | Pros | Cons (Your Opening) |
|-------------|-------------|------|---------------------|
| Do nothing / Status quo | | | |
| DIY solution | | | |
| Competitor 1: | | | |
| Competitor 2: | | | |
| Different approach | | | |

### Positioning Against Each

| Alternative | Your Angle |
|-------------|------------|
| vs. Status quo | "Here's what it's costing you to not solve this" |
| vs. DIY | "You could do this yourself, but at what cost?" |
| vs. Competitor | "Unlike [X], we [differentiator]" |

---

## 7. One-Line Positioning

After completing the above, write your positioning statement:

### Formula 1: Problem → Solution → Outcome

> "We help [TARGET CUSTOMER] who struggle with [PROBLEM] by providing [SOLUTION], so they can [OUTCOME]."

### Formula 2: Alternative Comparison

> "Unlike [ALTERNATIVE], [YOUR PRODUCT] [KEY DIFFERENTIATOR] for [TARGET CUSTOMER] who need [OUTCOME]."

### Formula 3: Category Claim

> "The [CATEGORY] for [SPECIFIC AUDIENCE] who want [SPECIFIC OUTCOME]."

### Your Versions

| Type | Your Statement |
|------|----------------|
| Problem → Solution → Outcome | |
| Alternative Comparison | |
| Category Claim | |

## Quick Validation Checklist

Before moving to ICP and copy, verify:

- [ ] Can I find 100+ companies matching my target description?
- [ ] Can I detect my signals using available tools?
- [ ] Is the problem urgent enough that they'd take a meeting?
- [ ] Can I articulate the outcome in their language?
- [ ] Do I know what they're using today (my competition)?

If "no" to any, revisit that section.
