# Permissionless Value Framework

**Core Principle:** Give value BEFORE asking for anything. No permission needed, no meeting required.

**Key Insight:** Don't target experts. Find people encountering the problem for the first time with no coping mechanisms.

---

## What is Permissionless Value?

Traditional cold outreach:
> "Hey, we have a product. Want a demo?"

Permissionless value:
> "Hey, I noticed [SIGNAL]. Here's [SPECIFIC VALUE] that might help. No strings attached."

### The Difference

| Traditional | Permissionless Value |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Asks for time/meeting | Gives value upfront |
| Generic pitch | Specific to their situation |
| "Let me tell you about us" | "Here's something useful for you" |
| Requires response to get value | Value delivered in the message |
| Feels like sales | Feels like help |

---

## The 7 Rules of a True PVP

**For a message to qualify as a Permissionless Value Prop, it MUST meet ALL seven criteria:**

### ✅ Validation Checklist

1. **Independently Useful**
   - Provides value without requiring a meeting, call, or follow-up
   - Recipient can act on it immediately
   - Example: ✅ "Here's every ingredient in your Purple Haze line requiring MoCRA Section 605 disclosure"
   - Example: ❌ "Want to learn about compliance? Book a call."

2. **Relates to Your Value Proposition**
   - Connected to what your product or service does
   - Natural bridge to your solution (but doesn't require it)
   - Example: ✅ Compliance checklist → Compliance software
   - Example: ❌ Generic business advice unrelated to your offering

3. **Based on Public Data**
   - Uses information that doesn't require the prospect's permission
   - Synthesized from 2-5 public data sources
   - Example: ✅ FDA database + supplier data + retail distribution data
   - Example: ❌ "I analyzed your internal sales data..."

4. **Translates into Meaningful Insights**
   - Contextualizes information to the buyer's specific situation
   - Not just data dumping—shows what it means for THEM
   - Example: ✅ "Your 3 SDR job postings suggest you'll need to ramp them in 90 days"
   - Example: ❌ "Here's a list of all companies hiring SDRs"

5. **Goes Beyond Pain Identification**
   - Offers specific solutions, not just pointing out problems
   - Shows the path forward
   - Example: ✅ "Here's the exact documentation FDA will request + where to find it"
   - Example: ❌ "You're probably not MoCRA compliant. That's bad."

6. **Creates Information Asymmetry**
   - Provides insights that the prospect doesn't already have
   - Reveals non-obvious patterns or connections
   - Example: ✅ "I analyzed 50 companies at your stage—here's the pattern the successful ones follow"
   - Example: ❌ "Did you know restaurants need food suppliers?" (Captain Obvious)

7. **Concrete and Specific**
   - Includes actual names, numbers, dates, and locations
   - Not generic templates—tailored to their situation
   - Example: ✅ "Your Purple Haze line has three Section 605 ingredients"
   - Example: ❌ "Many cosmetics companies have compliance issues"

## Types of Permissionless Value

### Template-Based PVPs (Easier to Create, Good for Starting)

#### 1. **Framework/Template**
Give them a ready-to-use structure.

**Example:**
> "Noticed you're hiring 3 SDRs. Here's the exact 30-day onboarding plan we use: [link to doc]. Covers week-by-week activities, practice scenarios, and certification criteria."

**Pros:** Quick to create, immediately actionable
**Cons:** Less differentiated, easier to ignore

#### 2. **Resource/Tool**
Give them something immediately useful.

**Example:**
> "Saw you're building a sales team. Made this: [link to free tool/template/checklist]. Used by teams at [similar companies]."

**Pros:** High perceived value, shareable
**Cons:** Requires upfront creation time

#### 3. **Introduction/Connection**
Connect them to someone valuable.

**Example:**
> "You're hiring a VP Sales. I know 3 great candidates from [relevant companies]. Happy to intro - no fee, just helping."

**Pros:** Extremely high value, builds reciprocity
**Cons:** Requires real network, not scalable

### Data-Driven PVPs (Harder to Create, More Powerful)

#### 4. **Synthesized Insight**
Combine 2-5 public data sources to reveal non-obvious patterns.

**Example:**
> "I cross-referenced your 3 SDR job postings with LinkedIn data on your current team. Companies at your stage that ramp reps in <90 days all have [specific pattern]. Here's what I found..."

**Pros:** Creates information asymmetry, highly specific
**Cons:** Requires data synthesis, harder to automate

#### 5. **Existential Data Point**
Identify the ONE metric that matters most for their survival/success.

**Example (Cosmetics Manufacturer):**
> "Here's every ingredient in your Purple Haze line requiring MoCRA Section 605 disclosure, plus exact documentation the FDA will request. Non-compliance = products pulled from shelves by [date]."

**Pros:** Impossible to ignore, demonstrates deep expertise
**Cons:** Requires industry research, very specific

#### 6. **Comparative Analysis**
Show them how they compare to peers on a critical metric.

**Example:**
> "Pulled data on 200 companies in [their vertical]. Top performers all have [X] in common. Here's where you stand and the 3-month roadmap to close the gap."

**Pros:** Leverages competitive instinct, actionable
**Cons:** Requires benchmark data, can feel judgmental

## The Four-Phase PVP Creation Framework

**Use this framework to generate PVPs automatically for each offer.**

### Phase 1: IDENTIFY — Find the Existential Data Point

**Goal:** Discover the ONE metric that matters most for survival/success in this industry.

**How to Find It:**
- Search: `[industry] + crisis/regulations/bankruptcy rates`
- Look for: Compliance deadlines, utilization rates, revenue leakage, survival metrics
- Ask: "What keeps executives in this industry awake at night?"

**Examples by Industry:**
| Industry | Existential Metric |
|----------|-------------------|
| Equipment Rental | Utilization rate (idle assets = lost revenue) |
| Medical Practices | Revenue leakage (unbilled services) |
| Cosmetics Manufacturing | MoCRA compliance (non-compliance = products pulled) |
| Sales Teams | Ramp time (longer ramp = higher CAC) |

**AI Research Technique:**
- Use Exa for deep research: "What are the biggest operational risks facing [industry] companies?"
- Use Parallel to find companies experiencing this pain
- Expand context window for comprehensive data, contract for insights

### Phase 2: INVESTIGATE — Stitch 2-5 Data Sources

**Goal:** Combine public data sources to reveal who has the problem and how severe it is.

**Data Source Categories:**
1. **Regulatory/Compliance Data**
   - Government databases (FDA, OSHA, EPA)
   - Industry registrations
   - Compliance status

2. **Operational Signals**
   - Job postings (TheirStack)
   - Hiring patterns (LinkedIn)
   - Tech stack changes

3. **Financial Indicators**
   - Funding rounds (Crunchbase)
   - Revenue estimates (Sumble)
   - Growth signals

4. **Market Position**
   - Customer reviews
   - Distribution channels
   - Competitor analysis

**Example Synthesis (Cosmetics Compliance):**
```
FDA Registration Database (who's compliant/not)
  + Supplier Ingredient Data (what they're making)
  + Retail Distribution Data (revenue indicators)
  = Manufacturers with revenue + non-compliant + complex ingredients
```

**The Intersection = Your Target Segment**

### Phase 3: CALCULATE — Run the TAM Math

**Goal:** Ensure your segment is large enough to hit your goals.

**Formula:**
```
Total Accounts × Required Positive Rate × Meeting Conversion = Monthly Meetings
```

**Example:**
- 7,300 manufacturers
- 5% positive response rate
- 8% meeting book rate
- = 29 meetings/month (1.4% monthly TAM burn)

**Decision Rule:**
- ✅ If math works: Deploy the PVP
- ❌ If math doesn't work: Tighter segment OR better message

**Guidance:**
- Smaller TAM (5,000-10,000) = Need better message (20%+ positive rate)
- Larger TAM (50,000+) = Can use simpler message (1-5% positive rate)

### Phase 4: CONSTRUCT — Build the PVP Message

**Structure:**
```
[THEIR SPECIFIC SITUATION] + [VALUABLE INSIGHT] + [PATH FORWARD] + [OPTIONAL PRODUCT MENTION]
```

**Example (Cosmetics Compliance):**
> "Hi [Name],
> 
> I noticed your Purple Haze line is sold at [Retailer]. Great distribution!
> 
> [THEIR SPECIFIC SITUATION]
> 
> With MoCRA Section 605 taking effect [DATE], I pulled together every ingredient in Purple Haze that requires disclosure, plus the exact documentation the FDA will request during inspections.
> 
> [VALUABLE INSIGHT]
> 
> Here's the checklist: [link]
> - 3 Section 605 ingredients identified
> - Documentation requirements for each
> - Where to source the data
> 
> [PATH FORWARD]
> 
> You can gather this manually or we built [Product] to automate the tracking. Either way, hope this saves you some time.
> 
> [OPTIONAL PRODUCT MENTION]"

**Why It Works:**
- ✅ Immediately actionable (start gathering docs today)
- ✅ Hyper-specific (their actual products, their actual ingredients)
- ✅ Independently valuable (useful even if they never buy)
- ✅ Creates urgency (compliance deadline)
- ✅ Demonstrates expertise (you know their business)

---

## The Basic Formula (For Simpler PVPs)

```
[SIGNAL OBSERVATION] + [SPECIFIC VALUE] + [EASY NEXT STEP]
```

### Breaking It Down

**1. Signal Observation**
- Shows you did research
- Proves relevance
- Creates curiosity
- Example: "Noticed you're hiring 3 SDRs"

**2. Specific Value**
- Immediately useful
- No strings attached
- Tailored to their situation
- Example: "Here's the 30-day onboarding plan we use"

**3. Easy Next Step**
- Low friction
- Their choice
- No pressure
- Example: "If you find it useful, happy to share more"

---

## Examples by Offer Type

### Example 1: Sales Training Tool

**Signal:** Hiring SDRs

**Bad (Traditional):**
> "Hi [Name], we help companies train sales reps faster. Want a demo?"

**Good (Permissionless Value):**
> "Hi [Name],
> 
> Saw you're hiring 3 SDRs. Congrats on the growth!
> 
> I built a simple framework for ramping new reps that cut onboarding from 6 months to 3 months at [similar company]. It's just a Google Doc with the exact sequence.
> 
> Here's the link: [link]
> 
> No signup, no pitch. Just thought it might save you some time.
> 
> If you end up using it and want to chat about what worked, happy to share more."

**Why it works:**
- ✅ Shows awareness (hiring 3 SDRs)
- ✅ Gives value immediately (framework)
- ✅ Social proof (worked at similar company)
- ✅ No ask (just offering help)
- ✅ Easy next step (optional chat)

### Example 2: DevOps Tool

**Signal:** Hiring DevOps engineers

**Permissionless Value:**
> "Hi [Name],
> 
> Noticed you're hiring DevOps engineers. I analyzed the interview questions from 30 top engineering teams.
> 
> Here's what the best ones ask: [link to doc]
> 
> Includes:
> - Technical scenarios that reveal real skills
> - Red flags to watch for
> - Scoring rubric
> 
> Free to use, no catch. Built it for [similar company] and they filled 5 roles in 6 weeks.
> 
> If you find it useful, let me know - happy to share more."

↓
AI reads: offers/{slug}/pvp-strategy.md
↓
AI generates: 5 PVP message variations
↓
AI self-critiques: Against 7 Rules checklist
↓
Output: Messages for user review
```

### AI Generation Prompt Template

**When generating PVPs, Cursor AI will use this internal prompt:**

```
You are generating a Permissionless Value Prop for:
- Offer: [offer name]
- Target Company: [company name]
- Signal: [hiring SDRs / raised funding / etc]
- Existential Metric: [from pvp-strategy.md]

Step 1: Synthesize public data
- Use Exa to research: [company] + [signal]
- Use Parallel to find: [specific data points]
- Combine sources to create insight

Step 2: Construct PVP using Phase 4 structure
- Their specific situation (reference the signal)
- Valuable insight (synthesized from data)
- Path forward (actionable next steps)
- Optional product mention (from positioning)

Step 3: Validate against 7 Rules
- [ ] Independently useful?
- [ ] Relates to value prop?
- [ ] Based on public data?
- [ ] Meaningful insights?
- [ ] Beyond pain identification?
- [ ] Information asymmetry?
- [ ] Concrete and specific?

Step 4: Generate 5 variations
- Vary the angle (insight vs template vs intro)
- Vary the tone (formal vs casual)
- Vary the length (short vs detailed)

Output: 5 validated PVP messages
```

### Manual PVP Creation (For Users)

**If creating PVPs manually, follow these steps:**

#### Step 1: Identify the Pain Point
Based on the signal, what are they struggling with RIGHT NOW?

| Signal | Likely Pain Point | Existential Metric |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|
| Hiring salespeople | Don't know how to train them | Ramp time |
| Raised funding | Need to scale fast | Burn rate vs growth |
| New VP Sales | Pressure to show results | Pipeline velocity |
| Using competitor | Probably has gaps/frustrations | Churn risk |

#### Step 2: What Can You Give Them?

**Template-Based (Quick):**
- Checklist
- Template
- Framework
- Tool

**Data-Driven (Powerful):**
- Synthesized insight (2-5 data sources)
- Comparative analysis (them vs peers)
- Existential data point (compliance, risk, opportunity)

Ask: "What could I create in 30-60 minutes that would genuinely help?"

#### Step 3: Make It Specific

**Too generic:**
> "Here's a guide to sales training"

**Specific:**
> "Here's the exact 30-day onboarding plan we use for SDRs at [company], including the 50 practice scenarios that cut ramp time from 6 months to 3 months"

**Even more specific (data-driven):**
> "I analyzed your 3 SDR job postings + your current team on LinkedIn. Companies at your stage that ramp reps in <90 days all have [specific pattern]. Here's the breakdown..."

#### Step 4: Deliver It

**In the message itself:**
- Short enough to include inline
- Example: "Here are the 3 things..."

**As a link:**
- Google Doc (no login required)
- Loom video
- Simple landing page
- PDF

**As an intro:**
- "Want me to intro you to [person]?"

---

## Permissionless Value + Your Product

**The goal is NOT to hide that you have a product.**

The goal is to lead with value, then mention the product naturally.

### The Structure

```
1. Value delivery (80% of message)
2. Natural transition (10%)
3. Optional product mention (10%)
```

### Example

> "Hi [Name],
> 
> Saw you're hiring SDRs. Here's the onboarding framework we use: [link]
> 
> Covers:
> - Week 1-4 activities
> - Practice scenarios
> - Certification criteria
> 
> [80% VALUE DELIVERED]
> 
> One thing we found: reps need 50+ practice reps before they're ready for real calls. Most teams don't have time for that.
> 
> [NATURAL TRANSITION]
> 
> That's actually why we built [product] - gives reps unlimited practice. But the framework works with or without it.
> 
> [OPTIONAL PRODUCT MENTION]
> 
> Either way, hope the framework helps!"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Captain Obvious
**Bad:** "Did you know restaurants need food suppliers?"
**Why it fails:** No information asymmetry—they already know this

**Fix:** Find non-obvious insights by synthesizing data sources

### ❌ Making It About You
**Bad:** "Our software has 47 features and we've been in business for 10 years!"
**Why it fails:** Violates "independently useful" rule—requires them to care about you

**Fix:** Lead with value for them, mention product optionally at the end

### ❌ Trying to Please Everyone
**Bad:** Generic message that could apply to any company in the industry
**Why it fails:** Not concrete and specific—fails Rule #7

**Fix:** Use the TAM math (Phase 3) to narrow your segment, then hyper-personalize

### ❌ Skipping Steps
**Bad:** Jumping straight to message writing without research
**Why it fails:** No data synthesis = no information asymmetry

**Fix:** Follow the Four-Phase Framework completely

### ❌ Pain Without Solution
**Bad:** "You're probably not MoCRA compliant. That's a huge problem."
**Why it fails:** Violates Rule #5 (goes beyond pain identification)

**Fix:** Always include the path forward—what they can do about it

### ❌ Requiring Permission
**Bad:** "I have some insights about your compliance status. Can we schedule a call to discuss?"
**Why it fails:** Violates core principle—value requires a meeting

**Fix:** Give the insights in the message itself

---

## When to Use Permissionless Value

### ✅ Use When:
- Breaking into new accounts (no existing relationship)
- Targeting senior people (they're busy, need immediate value)
- Competitive market (lots of noise, need to stand out)
- Complex/expensive product (long sales cycle, need to build trust)
- You have genuine expertise to share (can create real insights)
- Small TAM (need higher response rates)

### ⚠️ Don't Use When:
- You have a warm intro (just ask for meeting—leverage the relationship)
- Very simple product (demo is the value—just show it)
- Time-sensitive offer (need fast response—direct ask works better)
- You don't have real value to give (don't fake it—they'll see through it)
- Large TAM with simple message (traditional cold outreach may work fine)

---

## Measuring Success

### Traditional Metrics
- Open rate
- Reply rate
- Meeting rate

### Permissionless Value Metrics
- **Engagement rate** - Did they click/download/use the value?
- **Reply rate** - Higher than traditional (20-30% vs 5-10%)
- **Reply quality** - "This is great!" vs "Not interested"
- **Long-term relationship** - They remember you positively

### Expected Results

| Approach | Reply Rate | Meeting Rate | Feel |
|----------|-----------|--------------|------|
| Traditional cold | 5-10% | 1-2% | Salesy |
| Permissionless value | 20-30% | 5-10% | Helpful |

# PVP Strategy for [Offer Name]

## Phase 1: Existential Data Point
**Industry:** [e.g., Cosmetics Manufacturing]
**Existential Metric:** [e.g., MoCRA compliance status]
**Why it matters:** [e.g., Non-compliance = products pulled from shelves]

## Phase 2: Data Sources
1. **Source 1:** [e.g., FDA Registration Database]
   - **Access:** [e.g., Exa search for "FDA cosmetics registration"]
   - **Data points:** [e.g., Compliance status, registration date]

2. **Source 2:** [e.g., Retail distribution data]
   - **Access:** [e.g., Parallel company search]
   - **Data points:** [e.g., Where products sell, revenue indicators]

3. **Source 3:** [e.g., Ingredient databases]
   - **Access:** [e.g., Public supplier data]
   - **Data points:** [e.g., Product formulations, Section 605 ingredients]

**Synthesis Logic:**
Combine [Source 1] + [Source 2] + [Source 3] to identify:
- Companies with revenue (Source 2)
- Non-compliant status (Source 1)
- Complex ingredients requiring disclosure (Source 3)

## Phase 3: TAM Math
- **Total addressable accounts:** [e.g., 7,300]
- **Target positive response rate:** [e.g., 5%]
- **Target meeting book rate:** [e.g., 8%]
- **Expected monthly meetings:** [e.g., 29]
- **Monthly TAM burn:** [e.g., 1.4%]
- **Runway:** [e.g., ~71 months]

**Decision:** ✅ Deploy / ❌ Refine segment or message

## Phase 4: PVP Message Structure
**Template:**
[Their specific situation based on Source 2]
+ [Valuable insight from synthesizing all sources]
+ [Path forward with specific action steps]
+ [Optional product mention]
```

### Asset Types to Create

#### 1. Template-Based Assets (Create 2-3)
**Quick to create, immediately useful:**
- Checklist (e.g., "30-day onboarding checklist")
- Framework (e.g., "Sales ramp framework")
- Tool (e.g., "ROI calculator")
- Template (e.g., "Job description template")

**Storage:** `offers/{slug}/permissionless-value/template-assets/`

#### 2. Data-Driven Strategy (Create 1)
**Harder to create, more powerful:**
- Document the data sources to use
- Document the synthesis logic
- Cursor AI will execute this automatically

**Storage:** `offers/{slug}/permissionless-value/data-driven/`

## Creating Your First PVP

### Quick Start Exercise

**Answer these questions to generate your first PVP:**

1. **What signal are you targeting?**
   Example: "Hiring 3+ SDRs"

2. **What's the existential metric for companies with this signal?**
   Example: "Sales rep ramp time (longer = higher CAC, slower growth)"

3. **What pain does that signal indicate RIGHT NOW?**
   Example: "Need to train new reps fast but don't have a system"

4. **What 2-3 public data sources could you combine?**
   Example:
   - Job postings (TheirStack)
   - Current team size (LinkedIn via Parallel)
   - Company stage/funding (Crunchbase via Exa)

5. **What insight would synthesizing these sources reveal?**
   Example: "Companies at their stage that ramp reps in <90 days all have [specific pattern]"

6. **What could you create in 30-60 minutes that would help?**
   Example: "30-day SDR onboarding checklist with 50 practice scenarios"

7. **What would make it specific and credible?**
   Example: "Used at [similar company], ramped 10 reps in 90 days, cut ramp time in half"

8. **How will you deliver it?**
   Example: "Google Doc, no login required"

9. **What's the optional product mention?**
   Example: "We built [product] to automate the practice scenarios, but the checklist works with or without it"

10. **Validate against the 7 Rules:**
    - [ ] Independently useful?
    - [ ] Relates to value prop?
    - [ ] Based on public data?
    - [ ] Meaningful insights?
    - [ ] Beyond pain identification?
    - [ ] Information asymmetry?
    - [ ] Concrete and specific?

### Secondary Sources (To Be Added as Needed)

**When generating PVPs, the AI may suggest adding these sources:**

- **Government APIs** (FDA, OSHA, EPA) - Compliance data
- **Industry Databases** - Vertical-specific data
- **Financial Data** (Crunchbase, PitchBook) - Funding, valuations
- **Review Sites** (G2, Capterra) - Product feedback, pain points
- **Social Media** (LinkedIn, Twitter) - Company activity, hiring

### How Cursor AI Uses These Sources

**During PVP generation, the AI will:**

1. **Read the pvp-strategy.md** to understand which sources to use
2. **Execute searches** using Exa and Parallel
3. **Synthesize data** according to the synthesis logic
4. **Validate** that all data is public and verifiable
5. **Construct PVP** using the Phase 4 structure

**Example workflow:**
```
Input: Generate PVP for Company X (hiring SDRs signal)
↓
AI reads: offers/sales-training/pvp-strategy.md
↓
AI executes:
- Exa: "Sales rep ramp time benchmarks for SaaS companies"
- Parallel: Get Company X's current team size and recent hires
- TheirStack: Get exact SDR job postings from Company X
↓
AI synthesizes:
"Company X is hiring 3 SDRs (TheirStack). Current team is 8 people (Parallel).
Companies at this stage that ramp in <90 days all have [pattern from Exa research]."
↓
AI constructs PVP using template
↓
AI validates against 7 Rules
↓
Output: Personalized PVP message
```
