# Use Case-Driven Outreach Framework

**Core Principle:** Work backwards from the perfect email. Research deeply, personalize specifically, demonstrate you understand their exact business.

**Key Insight:** Don't write templates. Write specific emails for specific companies with specific use cases backed by specific research.

---

## What is Use Case-Driven Outreach?

**Traditional approach:**
> "Here's what our product does. Want a demo?"

**Use case-driven approach:**
> "Based on [SPECIFIC BUSINESS DETAIL], you could use [PRODUCT] to [EXACT USE CASE]. Here's how it would work for your business: [SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION]."

### The Difference

| Template-Based | Use Case-Driven |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Generic use cases | Exact use case for their business |
| "Here's what we do" | "Here's what you could do" |
| Product features | Business outcomes |
| One-size-fits-all | Tailored to their situation |
| Assumes they'll figure it out | Shows them exactly how it works |

## The Backwards Planning Method

### Start with the End Result

**Step 1: Write the Perfect Email First**

Before any research, write what an excellent outreach email would look like:

```
Hi [Name],

I noticed [SPECIFIC BUSINESS DETAIL about their company].

Given [THEIR SITUATION], you could use [PRODUCT] to [EXACT USE CASE].

For example, with your [SPECIFIC ASPECT OF THEIR BUSINESS], you could:
- [Specific implementation step 1]
- [Specific implementation step 2]
- [Specific outcome they'd achieve]

Based on [DATA POINT about their business], this would likely [QUANTIFIED IMPACT].

[Optional: Here's how [similar company] did this]

Want to see how this would work for [their specific situation]?
```

**Step 2: Identify What You Need to Fill In**

Looking at the perfect email, what do you need to know?
- [ ] Specific business detail (what makes them unique?)
- [ ] Their situation (what signals indicate they need this?)
- [ ] Exact use case (which of our use cases fits them?)
- [ ] Specific aspect of their business (what would they implement this on?)
- [ ] Data point (what can we quantify about their business?)
- [ ] Quantified impact (what outcome can we estimate?)

**Step 3: Design the Research Process**

Now that you know what you need, how do you get it?

## The Research & Analysis Framework

### Phase 1: Use Case Mapping

**For each use case your product enables, document:**

#### Use Case Template

```markdown
## Use Case: [Name]

### Problem It Solves
[What pain point does this address?]

### Who Needs This
**Signals:**
- [Signal 1: e.g., "Has 50+ sales reps"]
- [Signal 2: e.g., "Uses Salesforce"]
- [Signal 3: e.g., "Hiring sales managers"]

**Industries:**
- [Industry 1]
- [Industry 2]

**Company Characteristics:**
- [Size, stage, tech stack, etc.]

### Symptoms of the Problem
**How do we know they have this problem?**
- [Observable symptom 1]
- [Observable symptom 2]
- [Observable symptom 3]

### Research Required
**What data do we need to gather?**
1. [Data point 1] - Source: [Where to get it]
2. [Data point 2] - Source: [Where to get it]
3. [Data point 3] - Source: [Where to get it]

### Quantification Strategy
**How do we quantify their pain?**
- Formula: [e.g., "# of reps × avg ramp time × cost per rep"]
- Benchmarks needed: [e.g., "Industry avg ramp time"]
- Estimation method: [e.g., "Use LinkedIn to count reps"]

### Specific Implementation
**What would they actually do with our product?**
- Step 1: [Specific action]
- Step 2: [Specific action]
- Step 3: [Specific action]

### Expected Outcome
**What result would they achieve?**
- [Quantified outcome 1]
- [Quantified outcome 2]
- Timeline: [How long to see results]
```

### Phase 2: Company Research Process

**For each target company, gather:**

#### 1. **Business Context**
- What do they do? (specific products/services)
- Who do they serve? (specific customer segments)
- How do they make money? (business model)
- What stage are they at? (growth indicators)

**Sources:**
- Website (about page, case studies, blog)
- LinkedIn (company page, employee posts)
- Exa (news, press releases, interviews)
- Crunchbase (funding, growth)

#### 2. **Operational Signals**
- What are they building? (job postings)
- What tools do they use? (tech stack)
- What are they struggling with? (review sites, forums)
- What are they celebrating? (LinkedIn posts, press)

**Sources:**
- TheirStack (job postings, tech stack)
- Parallel (LinkedIn data, company info)
- G2/Capterra (reviews of tools they use)
- Social media (LinkedIn, Twitter)

#### 3. **Quantifiable Data Points**
- Team size (total, by department)
- Growth rate (hiring velocity, funding)
- Customer base (number, type, geography)
- Revenue indicators (funding, employee count estimates)

**Sources:**
- LinkedIn (employee count, recent hires)
- Parallel (enrichment data)
- Sumble (revenue estimates)
- Job postings (team expansion)

#### 4. **Use Case Fit Analysis**
- Which use case(s) fit this company?
- What specific aspect of their business would they apply it to?
- What data supports that they have the problem?
- What outcome could they achieve?

**Analysis:**
- Match signals to use case criteria
- Identify specific implementation details
- Calculate estimated impact
- Find proof points (similar companies, benchmarks)

### Phase 3: Email Construction

**Now that you have the research, build the email:**

#### The Structure

```
[HOOK: Specific business detail that shows research]
↓
[CONTEXT: Their situation that indicates they need this]
↓
[USE CASE: Exact use case for their business]
↓
[IMPLEMENTATION: Specific steps for their situation]
↓
[IMPACT: Quantified outcome based on their data]
↓
[PROOF: Similar company or benchmark]
↓
[CTA: Specific to their situation]
```

#### Writing Guidelines

**1. Be Hyper-Specific**
- ❌ "You could automate your sales process"
- ✅ "You could automate the lead routing for your 12 SDRs in the Austin office"

**2. Use Their Language**
- Reference their actual products, services, customers
- Use terminology from their industry
- Mirror their company's tone (formal vs casual)

**3. Quantify Everything**
- ❌ "This would save you time"
- ✅ "Based on your 50-person sales team, this would save ~200 hours/month"

**4. Show the Implementation**
- ❌ "Our product can help with this"
- ✅ "You'd connect this to your Salesforce instance, set up rules for your 3 territories, and your SDRs would get instant notifications"

**5. Make It About Them**
- 80% about their business
- 15% about the use case/outcome
- 5% about your product

---

## The 5-Email Generation Process

**When generating outreach emails, create 5 variations:**

### Email 1: Deep Research + Quantified Impact
**Focus:** Show you've done extensive research, quantify their pain

**Example:**
> "Hi [Name],
> 
> I noticed you're hiring 3 SDRs in Austin (saw the postings on LinkedIn). With your current team of 12 reps, that's a 25% expansion.
> 
> Based on typical SaaS ramp times, those 3 reps will take ~4 months to hit quota. That's 12 months of combined ramp time, costing roughly $180K in salary + overhead before they're productive.
> 
> Companies at your stage using [Product] for new hire onboarding cut that ramp time to 6 weeks. For your 3 new reps, that's saving ~2.5 months each = 7.5 months total.
> 
> Specifically, you'd:
> - Upload your current sales playbook
> - Set up practice scenarios for your [specific product]
> - Have new reps do 50 mock calls before their first real call
> 
> [Similar company] did this and ramped 8 reps in 45 days. Want to see how this would work for your Austin team?"

### Email 2: Use Case + Specific Implementation
**Focus:** Show exactly how they'd use it for their specific business

**Example:**
> "Hi [Name],
> 
> Saw you're expanding into enterprise (congrats on the [Company X] deal!).
> 
> One thing we've seen: companies moving upmarket struggle with deal complexity. Your AEs are used to 2-week sales cycles, but enterprise deals take 3-6 months with 5+ stakeholders.
> 
> You could use [Product] to:
> - Create a multi-threading playbook for your enterprise deals
> - Track which stakeholders your AEs have engaged (Economic Buyer, Champion, Technical Buyer)
> - Get alerts when deals stall because a key stakeholder hasn't been contacted
> 
> For your team of 8 AEs working 3-5 enterprise deals each, this would ensure no deals slip through the cracks.
> 
> [Similar company] increased enterprise close rate from 12% to 28% by systematically multi-threading. Want to see the playbook?"

### Email 3: Problem Symptom + Solution Path
**Focus:** Identify a specific symptom you've observed, show the path forward

**Example:**
> "Hi [Name],
> 
> I was looking at your team on LinkedIn - you've got 15 AEs but only 2 sales managers. That's a 7.5:1 ratio (industry avg is 5:1).
> 
> This usually means your managers are spending 80% of their time in 1:1s and deal reviews, with little time for coaching.
> 
> You could use [Product] to:
> - Automate deal reviews (AI analyzes pipeline, flags at-risk deals)
> - Record and analyze sales calls (identifies coaching opportunities)
> - Free up 10-15 hours/week per manager for strategic coaching
> 
> With 2 managers, that's 20-30 hours/week back. You could either:
> - Keep the 7.5:1 ratio and improve coaching quality
> - Scale to 10:1 ratio and delay your next manager hire
> 
> [Similar company] went from 6:1 to 9:1 ratio without sacrificing quota attainment. Want to see their approach?"

### Email 4: Competitive Intelligence + Differentiation
**Focus:** Show you understand their market, how they could differentiate

**Example:**
> "Hi [Name],
> 
> I noticed you're competing with [Competitor 1] and [Competitor 2] in the [market segment]. All three of you have similar features, pricing, and positioning.
> 
> One area where you could differentiate: implementation speed. I saw reviews mentioning [Competitor 1] takes 3-6 months to implement. If you could get customers live in 2 weeks, that's a huge advantage.
> 
> You could use [Product] to:
> - Create a self-serve onboarding flow for your [specific product]
> - Automate the 12 setup steps that currently require CS involvement
> - Get customers to 'first value' in 48 hours vs 90 days
> 
> For your 50 new customers/month, this would:
> - Reduce CS onboarding time by 75%
> - Lower churn (faster time-to-value = higher retention)
> - Create a sales differentiator ('live in 2 weeks, not 3 months')
> 
> [Similar company] made 'fastest implementation' their #1 sales message and grew 3x. Want to see the playbook?"

### Email 5: Expansion Opportunity + Revenue Impact
**Focus:** Show how they could expand revenue with existing customers

**Example:**
> "Hi [Name],
> 
> I saw you raised a Series B ($25M) with a goal to hit $50M ARR in 24 months. That's 4x growth.
> 
> Looking at your pricing page, you have 3 tiers. Most SaaS companies at your stage get 40% of revenue from upsells/expansion. If you're at industry avg, you need $20M from new customers + $10M from expansion.
> 
> One way to hit that expansion number: automated usage-based upsells.
> 
> You could use [Product] to:
> - Track when customers hit 80% of their plan limits
> - Automatically suggest the right upgrade (based on their usage pattern)
> - Show ROI of upgrading (using their actual usage data)
> 
> For your 500 customers, if 20% upgrade and average upgrade is $500/mo, that's $1.2M ARR.
> 
> Specifically for your business:
> - You'd track [specific usage metric]
> - Trigger upgrade prompts at [specific threshold]
> - Show customers: 'You're using X, upgrade to Y and get Z'
> 
> [Similar company] added $3M ARR in 12 months with automated expansion. Want to see their workflow?"

## PVP vs Use Case-Driven: When to Use Each

### Use Permissionless Value When:
- ✅ Breaking into new accounts (no relationship)
- ✅ Very busy/senior prospects (need immediate value)
- ✅ Small TAM (need high response rates)
- ✅ You have unique insights to share (information asymmetry)
- ✅ Long sales cycle (building trust over time)

### Use Case-Driven When:
- ✅ Clear product-market fit (you know who needs what)
- ✅ Multiple use cases (different for different companies)
- ✅ Complex product (needs explanation of how it works)
- ✅ You have research resources (team, tools, time)
- ✅ Quantifiable impact (can calculate ROI)

### Combine Both When:
- 🎯 Lead with PVP (give value first)
- 🎯 Follow up with use case (show implementation)
- 🎯 Example: "Here's the framework (PVP). Here's how you'd use our product to automate it (use case)."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Writing Templates
**Bad:** "You could use [Product] to improve your sales process"
**Why it fails:** Not specific to their business

**Fix:** "You could use [Product] to automate lead routing for your 12 SDRs in Austin, saving your 2 sales managers 15 hours/week"

### ❌ Generic Use Cases
**Bad:** "Many companies use us for sales automation"
**Why it fails:** Doesn't show how it applies to THEM

**Fix:** "Given your 7.5:1 AE-to-manager ratio, you'd use this to automate deal reviews, freeing up 20 hours/week for your 2 managers"

### ❌ Fake Specificity
**Bad:** "I noticed you're in the SaaS industry"
**Why it fails:** Too obvious, not real research

**Fix:** "I noticed you're competing with [Competitor 1] and [Competitor 2] in the [specific market segment]"

### ❌ Unquantified Impact
**Bad:** "This would save you time and money"
**Why it fails:** Vague, not credible

**Fix:** "Based on your 50-person sales team, this would save ~200 hours/month, worth roughly $15K in productivity"

### ❌ No Implementation Details
**Bad:** "Our product can help with this"
**Why it fails:** Doesn't show HOW

**Fix:** "You'd connect this to your Salesforce instance, set up rules for your 3 territories, and your SDRs would get instant notifications when leads hit scoring thresholds"
