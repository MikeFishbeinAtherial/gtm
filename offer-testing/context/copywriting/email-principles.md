# Cold Email Principles

## The Goal

Get a reply. Not a sale. Not a meeting booked. Just a reply.

Everything in your email should serve this single goal.

## Core Principles

### 1. Relevance Over Cleverness

The #1 reason emails fail: they're not relevant to the recipient.

**Ask yourself:**
- Why THIS person?
- Why THIS company?
- Why NOW?

If you can't answer these, you're spamming.

### 2. Short and Scannable

**Target lengths:**
- Subject line: 3-7 words
- Email body: 50-100 words
- Sentences: Under 15 words
- Paragraphs: 1-2 sentences max

People scan, they don't read. Make it easy.

### 3. One Clear CTA

One email = one ask.

**Good CTAs:**
- "Worth a quick chat?"
- "Open to learning more?"
- "Does this resonate?"

**Bad CTAs:**
- "Book a demo and also check out our blog and follow us on LinkedIn"

### 4. Sound Human

Write like you're emailing a colleague, not a prospect.

**Remove:**
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "I wanted to reach out because"
- "I'd love the opportunity to"
- "Please don't hesitate to"

**Keep:**
- First person ("I", "we")
- Contractions ("I'm", "we've")
- Questions

## Email Structure

### The Formula

```
[1 line: Why them specifically]
[1-2 lines: The problem/observation]
[1-2 lines: How we help]
[1 line: Social proof - optional]
[1 line: CTA as a question]
```

### Example

> Noticed you're scaling the SDR team at {{company_name}} - congrats on the growth.
>
> Most sales leaders I talk to say ramping new reps takes 4-6 months. We've helped teams like Gong and Outreach cut that to 6 weeks using AI roleplay.
>
> Worth a quick chat to see if it fits?

## Subject Lines

### What Works

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Question | "Quick question about SDR ramp?" |
| Observation | "{{company_name}} + AI training" |
| Mutual connection | "{{mutual_name}} suggested I reach out" |
| Trigger-based | "Saw you're hiring SDRs" |
| Simple | "Hi {{first_name}}" |

### What Doesn't Work

- ALL CAPS
- Emojis (usually)
- Clickbait ("You won't believe this")
- Fake RE: or FWD:
- Long subject lines (>50 chars)

## Personalization

### Levels of Personalization

| Level | Effort | Impact | Example |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| None | Low | Low | Generic email |
| Segment | Low | Medium | Industry-specific copy |
| Company | Medium | High | Mention their company news |
| Person | High | Highest | Reference their LinkedIn post |

### Where to Personalize

1. **Subject line** - Their name or company
2. **Opening line** - Why them specifically
3. **Problem** - Their specific version of it
4. **Proof** - Similar companies to them

### Personalization Variables

| Variable | Source | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `{{first_name}}` | Contact data | "Mike" |
| `{{company_name}}` | Company data | "Acme Corp" |
| `{{title}}` | Contact data | "VP of Sales" |
| `{{signal}}` | Research | "Saw you just raised Series B" |
| `{{mutual}}` | LinkedIn | "We're both connected to Sarah" |

## The 3-Email Sequence

### Email 1: Initial Outreach (Day 0)

**Goal:** Get on their radar, get a reply

**Structure:**
- Personalized opener (why them)
- The problem you solve
- Brief credibility
- Soft CTA

### Email 2: Follow-up (Day 3-4)

**Goal:** Add value, stay relevant

**Approaches:**
- Share a relevant resource
- Different angle on the problem
- Ask a question
- Reference something new

**Don't:** Just say "bumping this up" or "circling back"

### Email 3: Break-up (Day 7-10)

**Goal:** Create urgency, give easy out

**Structure:**
- Acknowledge you've emailed before
- Restate value briefly
- Give them an out ("If timing's bad, no worries")
- Final soft CTA

## What to Avoid

### Spam Triggers (Deliverability)

- Too many links
- Images in cold emails
- Words like "free," "guarantee," "limited time"
- Sending from new domain without warmup
- High volume from single account

### Turn-offs (Response Rate)

- Talking about yourself too much
- Long paragraphs
- Multiple CTAs
- Obvious templates ("Companies like yours")
- Asking for too much too soon

## Testing Framework

### What to A/B Test

| Element | Priority | Example Variations |
|---------|----------|-------------------|
| Subject line | High | Question vs. statement |
| Opening line | High | Problem vs. observation |
| CTA | Medium | Question vs. statement |
| Length | Medium | 50 words vs. 100 words |
| Proof point | Low | Different case studies |

### How to Test

1. Pick ONE variable to test
2. Split audience 50/50
3. Send minimum 50 per variation
4. Wait 7 days for full data
5. Winner becomes the new control
