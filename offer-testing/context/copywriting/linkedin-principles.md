# LinkedIn Messaging Principles

## Platform Context

LinkedIn is different from email:
- People are in "professional mode"
- Character limits force brevity
- Connection degree matters
- Profile is visible (social proof)
- Spam tolerance is LOW

## Connection Request Strategy

### The Golden Rule

**Connection request ≠ Sales pitch**

The goal is to GET CONNECTED, not to sell. Selling in the connection request kills your accept rate.

### Character Limit

**300 characters maximum** (including spaces)

This is short. Every word must earn its place.

### What Works

| Approach | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Shared interest | "Fellow sales leader - would love to connect and learn from your posts on SDR coaching." |
| Mutual connection | "Saw we're both connected to {{name}}. Would love to connect." |
| Content engagement | "Loved your post on [topic]. Resonated with my experience. Let's connect." |
| Relevant to them | "Building out our SDR team and learning from how {{company}} has scaled. Would love to connect." |
| Industry peer | "Always looking to connect with other [industry] folks. Great to see what you're building." |

### What Doesn't Work

| Approach | Why It Fails |
|----------|--------------|
| "I have a solution for you" | Too salesy, ignored |
| Long pitch | Can't fit, overwhelming |
| Generic "let's connect" | No reason to say yes |
| "I'd love to pick your brain" | Feels like taking |
| Fake flattery | Transparent, off-putting |

### Connection Request Template

```
[Why you specifically - shared interest/connection/observation]
[What value you might offer - optional, subtle]
[Simple ask to connect]
```

**Example:**
> Saw you're scaling the sales team at {{company}} - impressive growth. Always learning from sales leaders doing it well. Would love to connect.

---

## Follow-up DM (After Accepted)

### Timing

Wait **24-48 hours** after connection accepted. Immediate pitch = blocked.

### Structure

```
[Acknowledge the connection - genuine]
[Brief context - who you are/why you connected]
[Light value/observation - not a pitch]
[Soft question - optional]
```

### Example

> Thanks for connecting, {{first_name}}!

> I noticed you're hiring SDRs - exciting time for the team. Curious how you're thinking about ramping them? We've been working on some AI-powered practice tools that sales teams are loving.

> No pitch, just genuinely curious if it's something you've explored.

### What to Avoid

- Immediately asking for a call
- Sending your full pitch
- Copy-pasting the same message
- Sending links right away
- Multiple follow-ups without response

## InMail (For 3rd Degree)

### When to Use InMail

- Can't connect (no mutual connections, limited)
- High-value target worth the credit
- Time-sensitive opportunity

### InMail Differences

| Aspect | Connection Request | InMail |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| Character limit | 300 | 1900 |
| Cost | Free | Credits |
| Open rate | Lower (feed noise) | Higher (notification) |
| Expectation | Networking | Business |

### InMail Structure

```
[Subject: Short, relevant - not salesy]

[Opening: Why them specifically]
[Problem/observation: What you've noticed]
[Solution hint: How you might help]
[Proof: Brief credibility]
[CTA: Soft, question-based]
```

### InMail Example

**Subject:** Quick thought on SDR ramp

> Hi {{first_name}},

> Noticed {{company}} is scaling the sales team - congrats on the growth.

> Talked to a lot of sales leaders lately dealing with the same challenge: ramping new SDRs takes 4-6 months, and it's expensive when they churn before hitting quota.

> We've built AI roleplay bots that let reps practice objection handling 24/7. Teams like Gong are cutting ramp time in half.

> Might be relevant, might not be - but curious if faster ramp time is on your radar?

## LinkedIn Safety Limits

### Daily Limits (Critical)

| Action | Safe Limit | Max Limit |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Connection requests | 20/day | 25/day |
| Messages (DMs) | 40/day | 50/day |
| Profile views | 80/day | 100/day |
| InMails | Limited by credits | - |

### Best Practices

1. **Spread throughout the day** - Don't send 20 requests in 5 minutes
2. **Business hours only** - 9am-6pm in recipient's timezone
3. **Warm up new accounts** - Start with 5/day, increase gradually
4. **Skip 1st degree** - Don't cold message existing connections
5. **Personalize** - Identical messages get flagged

### What Gets You Restricted

- Too many requests/messages too fast
- High "I don't know this person" rate
- Identical messages to many people
- Selling in connection requests
- Automation tools (if detected)

---

## Engagement-First Strategy

### The Idea

Engage with their content BEFORE reaching out. This:
- Gets you on their radar
- Creates familiarity
- Gives you something to reference
- Increases accept/response rate

### How to Do It

1. Follow their profile
2. Like 2-3 of their posts
3. Leave 1-2 thoughtful comments
4. Wait 3-5 days
5. Send connection request

### Comment Guidelines

| Good Comments | Bad Comments |
|---------------|--------------|
| Add to the discussion | "Great post!" |
| Share your perspective | "Agree" |
| Ask a thoughtful question | "Check out my product" |
| Reference your experience | "Love this" |

## Response Handling

### Positive Response

**Goal:** Move to next step (call, meeting)

**Approach:**
- Thank them
- Propose specific next step
- Make it easy (provide times, calendly)

### Negative Response

**Goal:** Leave door open, stay professional

**Approach:**
- Thank them for the response
- No pushback or arguing
- Offer to stay connected
- Maybe they'll think of someone else

### No Response

**Goal:** One follow-up, then move on

**Approach:**
- Wait 5-7 days
- One gentle follow-up
- Different angle or value
- If no response, stop
