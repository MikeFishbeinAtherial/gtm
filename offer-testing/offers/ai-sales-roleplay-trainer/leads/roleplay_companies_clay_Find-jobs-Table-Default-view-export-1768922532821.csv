Computer is not just another tool. It’s built on the belief that the future of work should be about genuine human connection and collaboration – not piling on more apps.

Computer is the best kind of teammate: it amplifies your strengths, takes repetition and frustration out of your day, and gives you more time and energy to do your best work.

How?

Easy: it’s the only platform capable of…

1. Complete data unification

Most AI products focus on either structured data (like CRM records and support tickets), or unstructured data (like documents and emails). Computer AirSync connects everything, unifying all your data sources (like Google Workspace, Jira, Notion) into one AI-ready source of truth: Computer Memory.

2. Powerful search, reasoning, and action

Once connected to all your tools and apps, Computer is embedded in your full business context. It can find and summarize, sure. Even more impressive: it offers employees insights, strategic and proactive suggestions, plus powerful agentic actions.

3. Extensions for your teams and customers

Computer doesn’t make you choose between new software and old. Its AI-native platform lets you extend existing tools with sophisticated apps and agents. So your teams – and your customers – can take action, seamlessly. These agents work alongside you: updating workflows, coordinating across teams, and syncing back to your systems.

Talent Acquisition, Recruitment & Hiring and helping businesses build a high-performing remote team.

We believe in the potential of African talent: 
By 2035, Africa will boast the largest and youngest workforce in the world, opening up enormous potential for businesses and talent development.

For businesses, this means a growing customer base and a larger pool of talent to drive business objectives. In the talent industry, this requires us to create a robust cycle of talent building, training, and retraining to prepare for the business expansion in Africa. 
At Hirelitics, we maintain an expanding talent pool where we identify, train, and prepare individuals for global impact.

As the scramble for top talents gets intense, we want your business to stand out. We help businesses in Nigeria and Africa to design, implement and manage an adaptive, data-driven and AI-enabled recruitment strategy that attracts the right talent to build their dream team.

We offer services both remotely and onsite but we only source remote roles.
Our advantage is we leverage cutting-edge recruitment technology and implement data-driven and AI-enabled recruitment tactics to build a growing talent pool of the top 1% of remote workers in Nigeria.
We are also expanding to other African nations.

Several prominent brands have benefited from our expertise, including crowdworking platforms such as Linguist Tank (LXT), Translated, SkyFall A.I., APPEN, Lionsbridge, Telus.AI, Cognegica, and Future Group Translations.

Critical Start is a Managed Detection and Response (MDR) provider built for outcomes. We combine expert analysts and clear service-level agreements to deliver speed, accuracy, and transparency.

We reduce noise with precision alert handling. Threats are escalated to our analysts. Non-threats are resolved with full context. Every alert is classified and every decision is visible in a unified timeline. You always know what’s happening and why.

Our SOC is staffed 24x7x365 with analysts trained to act fast. We guarantee a 10-minute notification for critical alerts and a 60-minute mean time to respond for all alerts. These SLAs are contractual, not vague promises.

We integrate directly with the tools you already use. That means faster containment, fewer delays, and no need to rip and replace. Our Signal Assurance process also identifies blind spots, missed log sources, and hidden assets, giving you full coverage across endpoint, cloud, identity, OT, and more.

When a threat hits, we don’t just tell you. We respond.

If your current MDR only notifies, or leaves you unsure what’s being monitored, it may be time for something better.

Fact: 75% of Americans either don’t trust or don’t like the taste of tap water. Also fact: Clean water is more than a necessity, it’s the foundation for healthy lives and a sustainable future. We believe everyone deserves access to contaminant-free drinking water—without the plastic packaging. 

Eleven years ago, we set out to create a water Refill Station that removes over 99% of contaminants commonly found in drinking water – looking at you, lead, bacteria, microplastics, nanoplastics, and heavy metals.

Honeycomb’s approach is fundamentally different from other tools that claim observability, and is built to help teams answer novel questions about their ever-evolving cloud applications.

Other tools silo your data across disjointed pillars (logs, metrics, and traces), are too slow, and constrain teams to only answer predetermined questions. Honeycomb unifies all data sources in a single type, returning queries in seconds – not minutes – and revealing critical issues that logs and metrics alone can’t see. Using the power of distributed tracing and a query engine designed for highly-contextual telemetry data, Honeycomb reveals both why a problem is happening and who specifically is impacted.

Every interface is interactive, enabling any engineer – no matter how tenured – to ask questions on the fly, drill down by any dimension and solve issues before customers notice. Powered by machine learning, BubbleUp enables you to quickly spot outliers that reveal  the cause of hidden issues. Engineering teams can deploy confidently, resolve incidents faster and focus on high-value work that drives innovation.","25M-75M","$50M - $100M",,,,,,,,

Virtual Blue Monitoring combines human monitoring with AI-powered video surveillance, without sacrificing an on-site presence. It allows for complete and effective coverage of your property, at a reduced cost to traditional options, and can be incorporated into your current cameras. Filtering out unnecessary noise, human actions are immediately reviewed by a trained operator to determine if a crime is occurring or about to occur. Then through either (or a combination of) verbal warnings via a speaker, alerts to law enforcement that are video verified to guarantee a faster response, or dispatching of an on-the-ground security team issues are prevented.

The result is better security, happier tenants, and reduced security costs. Our customers typically reduce costs by 50-60%, while gaining full constant coverage of their properties, and can add-on additional security coverage as needed. Property owners and managers can increase NOI, through a combination of less issues / property damage and the ability to better justify rent increases. On the flip side, tenants feel safer as incident rates plummet and knowing that security coverage is more than a single person who can only make rounds at set intervals.","1M-5M","Funding unknown",,,,,,,,

We unite digital labor strategy to onboard digital workers, recruiting technology to hire human workers, and platform expertise to drive more meaningful business impact, faster.

The future of work isn't human or digital.
It's human and digital, orchestrated as one.

The truth is, every company already has a hybrid workforce, they just haven't recognized it yet. Every digital tool, GPT, agent is a digital teammate waiting for orchestration. The advantage now belongs to those who think differently about work: who see digital labor not as a risk to manage, but as an opportunity to expand what their business can achieve. The companies that will lead the next decade understand this. 

Success is not about replacing humans, it’s about elevating them. Freeing people from repetitive execution to focus on trust, relationships, and creativity. Productivity isn't measured in hours worked but in knowledge retained and multiplied.

We can help you meet this moment head on. We went first so we can help you move fast. Operating as our own customer zero we've spent the past year orchestrating our own hybrid workforce driving toward a goal to have 40% of our workforce made up of digital labor in 2026.

We have on boarded over 60 digital workers across 10 functions operating with a 5:1 digital-to-human work ratio, and achieved $5 million in savings driving a 17% return on investment as a business. """,,"Funding unknown",,,,,,,,

We do it because we believe that in a perfect world, the best cases should go to the best attorneys. Unfortunately, in today’s ultra-competitive legal landscape, the best cases go to the best marketers. We strive to bridge that gap so both can be true. We want the most game changing attorneys in the country to get the best cases, grow the strongest law firms, and make the greatest positive impact in their communities.

We walk our talk here at Crisp. We've been named to the Top 100 Fastest-Growing Private Companies in Atlanta ten years in a row [2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025] by the Atlanta Business Chronicle, we've earned the distinction of Top Workplace in Atlanta [2022, 2023. 2024], and we've been recognized on the Inc. 5000 List of Fastest-Growing Private Companies in the U.S. seven years [2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2024] — notably earning spots in the Top 10% two years in a row.

Our approach is to take everything we've learned generating massive growth in our own organization and help the country's most ambitious law firm owners do the same for theirs. We do this by equipping them with world-class legal video, relentless digital marketing, the top leadership & management coaching and workshop programs in the legal industry, and proven strategies to empower & align their teams.

Crisp is known as an innovative trailblazer in the legal industry. We have published the #1 best-selling book in Amazon's legal category (The Game Changing Attorney), host the #1 podcast for legal market leaders (The Game Changing Attorney Podcast), and put on the largest law firm growth conference on earth each year (Crisp Game Changers Summit).

It raised Series A funding of USD$24mm in 2023, one of the largest Series-A rounds for a European business that year.  

Its award-winning B2C digital wallet HyperJar is the spending super-app:  a brilliantly effective, visuallyengaging account with a prepaid debit card that helps people to Spend Life Well. Behind the simple idea of managing money in digital jamjars is a lot of world-first tech, offering access to all types of instant rewards – including up to 1.5% cashback on all spending. These rewards sit alongside unique tools for organising, sharing and controlling spending. The ability to share money in a single ‘jar’ with other people solves a myriad of devolved spending challenges in a way no other account can: sports teams paying in subs and spending from one source; parents managing expenses with a child-minder; housemates sharing bills; a couple wanting something less formal than a joint bank account. 

The app currently has 600,000 customers and has been thetop-rateddigital account on the major UK review and app store sites for over 12 months.  

HyperLayer is the company’s B2B venture. It provides unique tech capabilities globally to organisations who want to offer enhanced spending and other services to their customers or employees. These organisations include banks, asset managers, pension funds, merchants, and any enterprise whose clients are also spenders.  

Since public launch into UK app stores in October 2020, HyperJar Ltd has won 14 awards for its proprietary technology, including Money Management Platform of the Year; Personal Finance Tech of the Year; Banking Tech of the Year and Best Future Payments Initiative in 2023.","10M-25M","$10M - $25M","❌ No Job Found",,,,,,,

At Olly Olly, we've learned that building a website is just 10% of the solution. The other 90% (Google Business Profile optimization, managing your online listings, maintaining social presence, monitoring competitors, and preparing for AI search) is what actually determines if potential customers find you, trust you, and contact you instead of your competition.
Unlike web designers who disappear after launch or agencies that operate like black boxes, we build and maintain everything your business needs to be found online while showing you exactly what's working through daily insights that take 2 minutes to check.
What makes us different:

We handle your complete online presence, not just a website
Real-time transparency: see what we're doing and why it matters
Competitive intelligence: know when rivals make moves and what to do about it
90% autopilot, 10% guided action (no overwhelm, no mystery)
Future-proofed for AI search (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity)

Whether you're in professional services, home services, retail, or growing a franchise, our mission is the same: empower your business to achieve durable growth through simplicity and clarity, turning everyday actions into sustainable results without requiring marketing expertise or dedicated time.","25M-75M","Funding unknown",,,,,,,,

Technology that improves the viewing experience, enables content discovery, and addresses audience fragmentation across screens will strengthen television’s business model and relevance to consumers. Data is at the center of any solution to make TV better.

Our first product, a 2” Polaris Sportsman EZ Install lift kit, came as a result of our founder Harold Hunt’s love of creek riding. The success of the lift kit, based on his own design, led Harold to set up shop in his own garage, which also served as the warehouse and shipping center. The intent was to fill a small need for off-road enthusiasts which was the same need he had for better Sportsman parts. He was delighted and surprised when it turned out the need was much, much greater than he realized, and it was growing every day. As the industry exploded and demand grew, so did SuperATV. It wasn’t just about 2″ Sportsman lifts anymore, it was about improving every part possible on every machine available. As the ideas multiplied and demand from avid riders grew, our product line expanded to include a full range of aftermarket parts, from axles to long travel kits.

We soon outgrew that humble garage, and we haven’t stopped growing since. We may be bigger, but we haven’t changed why we’re here: to offer enthusiasts, racers and the people who get things done, the best aftermarket ATV and UTV parts and accessories at the best prices. 

We’re fortunate enough to have a growing SuperATV family whom all share our love for riding and the great outdoors, and a drive to add that “one more thing” to make our machines run and perform better. We’re known to load up our trailers on Thursday night in anticipation of the weekend. Come Friday afternoon, we’re ready to hit the road, so we can join up with family and friends and hit the off-road. To us, riding isn’t a hobby. It’s a part of who we are.

Our product philosophy for our customers has eight pillars:

1. Security for all: We believe that security features should be accessible to all customers, regardless of their plan level.

2. Unobtrusive security: We design security features to be intuitive and easy to use and believe most of all they must not interfere with the user experience.

3. Secure by default: We build secure defaults out of the box.

4.Traceability: We believe visibility can drive accountability.

5.Store of no value: We strive to minimize the amount of valuable or sensitive data stored.

6. Fail securely: When we fail, we fail securely.

7. Least privilege: We grant users and systems only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their intended functions.

8. Complete mediation: We ensure that all user actions are fully authorized and authenticated at all times.

We went to our customers who gave us excellent feedback.  We heard all about:

The red tape and paperwork required by the leading national rental companies. 
Constant over promising -- and under delivering – by too many suppliers.
Unreliable equipment that breaks down in the middle of a project creating expensive downtime.
The frustrations of equipment not available when it’s needed.
We took all this to heart and decided to create a new kind of rental services company. But it had to be one that we ourselves would like to do business with. The result is nothing you’d expect, and everything you’d want from a rental services company.

We call it Texas First Rentals and we’d like you to give us a try.

If you have a construction project to complete, a facility to manage, or a special need to figure out, we have an affordable solution with a full line of aerial, dirt, and power equipment. We promise to do whatever it takes to make your job easier and more successful.
Texas First is a sister company of HOLT CAT, the largest Caterpillar dealer in the United States. The Holt family has been serving customers for over eight decades in the Texas market. We’ve learned the in’s and out’s of service, safety, quality, and high performance.
You can rent the Cat equipment you’ve always trusted for your toughest jobs – plus a whole lot more: equipment from Genie, JLG, Sullair, Wacker, Laymor, Vermeer and a lot of other top-notch manufacturers. We offer specialty equipment like booms, and aerial platforms along with pumps, welders and concrete & masonry equipment and tools.

The company was then located on the northeast side of Indianapolis. 
Although the company had always been successful, the real growth did not occur until the mid 1980’s, when Acorn became a member of the Network Services Co. and the Allied Buying Co. Membership in these buying and marketing groups improved Acorn’s buying power, industry contacts and the ability to sell to national and regional chain accounts. Acorn soon became a major distributor to all types of customers: hotels and motels, hospitals and nursing homes, industrial and retail accounts, government agencies, school districts and universities, and, of course, restaurants. The product line also began to expand to include janitorial product supplies as well as food service. In 1993, to reflect a more diverse product line, Acorn Paper and Restaurant Supply Co. changed its name to Acorn Distributors, Inc.
Acorn continued to grow and in the year 2000, moved to another location located near the Indianapolis Airport. In September, 2007, Acorn continued its growth with the acquisition of Cottingham Paper located in Columbus, Ohio and then acquired Unisan Columbus in 2022. In 2018, Acorn built a facility in Columbus, Ohio and in 2023, Acorn built another larger headquarters in Brownsburg, IN at 1625 W Northfield Dr. 
In 2005, Jennifer Rosenberg, Al’s daughter, became second-generation owner of Acorn allowing Acorn to apply for Women Business Enterprise certifications in Indiana and Louisville. In 2023, Acorn obtained its Women’s Business Enterprise National Council certification granting national WBE status for the company. 
Years of providing excellent customer service, quality product lines at competitive prices and the cultivation of a strong team of employees has given Acorn Distributors, Inc. a strong foundation to continue growing in the future.","10M-25M","Funding unknown",,,,,,,,

We are building AI agents that liberate HR teams, advance organizations, and expand human potential.

HR was never designed for impact. For decades, it has been trapped in legacy systems—built for record-keeping, not decision-making. Buried in manual tasks, fragmented tools, and static processes, HR teams struggle to keep up with the demands of modern work.

Outdated ATS and LMS systems force inefficiencies, and 90% of talent data remains unstructured, wasted, and unusable. Instead of engaging top talent or filling critical roles, HR is stuck in administrative work—screening, scheduling, and chasing candidates lost in slow, impersonal processes.

Maki changes that.

By combining human ingenuity with AI-driven intelligence, Maki transforms HR from an administrative function into a strategic powerhouse.

Our AI Agents don’t just assist—they take action. Fully autonomous, they embed into each company’s workflows, freeing HR to drive impact, not manage inefficiencies. 
No more wasted data. No more rigid systems. Just seamless, AI-powered talent intelligence that fuels business growth.","10M-25M","$25M - $50M",,,,,,,,

Originally named General Plate Company, it began by creating specialty clad metals to meet the needs of the local jewelry industry.  The company’s products included materials that had a surface of precious metal, for the desired appearance and cosmetic characteristics, but combined with additional metals which would enhance mechanical properties and reduced precious metal content and cost. This was the start of clad metals at Engineered Materials Solutions.
The company continued to grow and in 1931 it merged with Spencer Thermostat Company, becoming Metals & Controls Corporation. This new company offered customers the knowledge of metallurgically bonding dissimilar metals, while refining the technology to apply these materials to accomplish various tasks; such as, safety, thermal regulation and controls solutions for the burgeoning electrical, appliance and many other markets.
Metals & Controls merged with Texas Instruments in 1959 and the company’s reputation for metallurgical excellence, processing, and applications innovation continued to grow. Notable milestones include the invention of clad coinage for the U.S. Mint in 1964, the first application of stainless clad aluminum automobile trim in 1971, the first use of copper clad aluminum wire in CATV transmission lines in 1977, the first application of copper/invar/copper to control thermal expansion in electronics substrates and circuit boards in 1985, and the development of isobaric cold rolling – a solution to the problem of cold rolling brittle materials, in 1992.
In 2000 we became Engineered Materials Solutions, with our new name reflecting exactly what we have been providing since 1916; highly engineered materials that provide customized solutions to satisfy our customer and market needs.

Hyper Tools reduces the generality of large models through reinforcement learning, rapid development workflows and purpose built synthetic and manual Data creation.

Our focus spans four core thrust areas:

Physical AI Systems – Building AI/ML systems for physical infrastructure. Some of the world’s leading chemical and energy companies rely on CodeNinja’s outcome-based, vendor-independent models to enhance operational efficiency and revenue.

Work AI – Developing agentic AI systems that transform workplace processes into adaptive, intelligent experiences.

It all started with a vision in 2005. That vision was to create a full-service, entrepreneurial bank where answers came quickly, opportunities were plentiful, and the environment was positive and optimistic. It would be an unconventional bank where clients would notice a difference and people would be challenged to grow both professionally and personally. 

Almost 20 years later, this vision and unconventional model has led to continuous growth and profitability. Bridgewater Bank has: become a top-performing bank nationwide, attracted investments from top institutional firms from coast to coast, become the first Minnesota bank to complete a successful IPO in over 25 years, created an award-winning culture and earned a reputation as a bank that understands clients’ unique needs. Out of the 400+ banks in Minnesota today, Bridgewater sits among the top ten by asset size. 

But to each of us, this is more than a high-performing bank; it’s a sense of community. We are a team of nimble banking professionals who want to redefine what it means to work in this industry. As our entrepreneurial story continues, we will never lose sight of what makes this place extraordinary – a steadfast commitment to our people.

In our eyes, Restaurants don’t just fill your belly, they teach you about culture, mark important milestones in your life and when done right, make you feel like part of a community.  They are a vital thread in the fabric of life.  

inKind was inspired by our experience running a restaurant incubator in Washington D.C. There, we learned what it meant to be good operators, while also designing and testing our latest tech, enhancing the experience for restaurateurs and customers. By identifying the ongoing challenges facing the F&B industry firsthand, we created a unique model to fund restaurant ventures.

Through this innovative approach, inKind provides funding to restaurants of all shapes and sizes who are looking to grow. As part of our model, we take credit in the restaurants we fund and from it, market and sell high-dollar gift cards to guests. These customers then interact, transact, and enjoy positive experiences at their favorite restaurants thanks to our dedicated team and inKind app. This flywheel allows inKind to grow, ensures the success of restaurant operators, and provides customers a way to support and discover great restaurants.

The problem with traditional approaches to mobile testing is that you can never keep up. There’s always another device, another operating system, another page of the app that you just don’t have time to test. To make your app work better everywhere, you’ve got to go faster (with scriptless automation), go flexible (with more deployment options), and go forward (with continuous innovation) – and only Kobiton brings this “go, go, go” approach to mobile testing. Using real devices and next-gen automation, you can test your app in a fraction of the time it would normally take. The result: impeccable mobile experiences across more devices, operating systems, and use cases. That’s why so many companies from IBM to Coca-Cola to Uber already rely on Kobiton for mobile testing.
