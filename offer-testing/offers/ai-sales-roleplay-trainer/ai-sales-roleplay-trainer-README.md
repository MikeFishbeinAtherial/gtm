## Quick Summary

**What we do:**  
Build custom AI roleplay apps for B2B companies where their sales reps can practice unlimited calls with voice AI trained to act like their actual target prospects, then receive coaching from AI trained on their winning sales playbooks.

**Who it's for:**  
Sales leaders (CRO, VP Sales, Director of Sales) at B2B companies under 100 employees in the US who need to ramp new sales reps faster.

**Key problem we solve:**  
Sales reps aren't getting enough quality practice before real customer calls, leading to long ramp times (3-6 months), lost deals, and wasted manager time on repetitive coaching.

**Our differentiator:**  
Custom-built service (not off-the-shelf product) with AI trained on THEIR specific buyers and playbooks, delivered as voice (not text) to mimic real calls.

## Next Steps

1. **Run `/offer-campaign ai-sales-roleplay-trainer`** to create campaign ideas
2. Create 3-5 different campaign approaches with different:
   - Target signals (e.g., hiring sales roles, growing fast, using specific tools)
   - Messaging angles (PVP, use case, problem-focused)
3. Choose which campaigns to launch (pick best 1-2)
4. **Run `/offer-launch ai-sales-roleplay-trainer {campaign-slug}`** to find companies

## Campaign Ideas to Test

*These will be created using `/offer-campaign`. Some potential directions:*

1. **Hiring Signal Campaign** - Target companies actively hiring SDRs/AEs (they need training)
2. **Sales Tool Stack** - Target companies using Gong/Chorus (they care about call quality)
3. **High-Growth Signal** - Target companies scaling fast (need to train multiple reps quickly)
4. **Founder-led Sales** - Target companies transitioning from founder-led to sales team

*Create campaigns to test which signal + message combination works best.*
