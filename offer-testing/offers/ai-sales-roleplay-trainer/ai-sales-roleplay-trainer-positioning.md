## 3. Customer Problem

**The Problem:**  
Sales reps aren't getting enough quality practice before they get on real customer calls. Traditional training (videos, manuals, generic roleplay tools) doesn't prepare them for the specific objections and conversations they'll face with their actual target buyers.

**Who Feels It Most:**  
- CROs and VPs of Sales (responsible for team performance and ramp time)
- Sales Directors (managing underperforming reps)
- Founders/CEOs with small sales teams (every rep matters)

**What Happens If They Don't Solve It:**
- Long ramp times (3-6+ months for new reps to hit quota)
- Lost deals due to poor call execution
- Wasted sales leader time coaching the same issues repeatedly
- High rep turnover from lack of confidence
- Expensive mistakes on real prospect calls

**How They Describe It (Their Words):**
- "Our new reps sound robotic on calls"
- "I don't have time to roleplay with every rep"
- "They freeze up when prospects throw objections"
- "We're losing deals we should be winning"
- "Reps need more reps before they're ready"

## 5. Current Alternatives

| Alternative | Pros | Cons |
|-------------|------|------|
| **Manager-led roleplays** | Personalized feedback, builds team relationships | Time-intensive, limited availability, managers hate doing it |
| **Generic AI roleplay tools (Gong Engage, Second Nature)** | Available 24/7, scalable | Generic scenarios, not trained on company's specific pitch/buyers, lacks personalized coaching |
| **Video training courses** | Easy to scale, reusable | Passive learning, no practice, no feedback, boring |
| **Peer-to-peer practice** | Free, team building | Inconsistent quality, no expert feedback, reps teaching bad habits |
| **Hiring experienced reps** | No ramp time needed | Expensive, limited talent pool, still need to learn your specific pitch |

**Why Current Solutions Aren't Good Enough:**  
None combine the scalability of AI with the personalization of training on your specific sales process, buyer personas, and winning playbooks. Generic tools are one-size-fits-all; human coaching doesn't scale.
