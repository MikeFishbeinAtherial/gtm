## Signals (See `hiring-signal-new-sales-team-signals.md` for details)

**Primary Signal Stack: "Scaling Sales Team"**
1. ✅ Hiring 2+ sales roles (posted last 30 days) - **HIGH PRIORITY**
2. ✅ No Sales Enablement person on team - **HIGH PRIORITY**
3. ✅ Company under 100 employees - **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Secondary Signal Stack: "New Sales Leader"**
1. New VP Sales hired (last 90 days) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
2. Uses Gong/Chorus/Outreach - MEDIUM PRIORITY
3. Hiring sales roles - MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Why these signals:**
- Companies hiring sales reps NEED to train them
- No enablement person = training falls on busy managers
- Small company = every rep matters, budget-conscious

---

## Messaging Strategy (See `hiring-signal-new-sales-team-strategy.md` for details)

**Framework:** Use Case-Driven

**Why Use Case approach:**
- Clear problem (long ramp time)
- Quantifiable outcome (2x faster to quota)
- Specific implementation (custom AI trained on their playbook)
- Strong ROI story (manager time saved + faster revenue)

**Primary Use Case:** Onboarding New Sales Hires  
*Get new reps productive in 6 weeks instead of 12+ weeks*

**Secondary Use Case:** Scaling Without Scaling Manager Time

## Notes

- **Why this campaign first:** Hiring is the strongest signal - companies actively hiring sales reps definitively need training
- **Risk:** May be too narrow (under 100 employees + hiring 2+ roles = small TAM)
- **Mitigation:** Can expand to 1+ roles if needed, or remove company size constraint
- **Alternative campaigns to test:** New VP Sales angle, Tech Stack Gap (using Gong but no training), Rapid Growth signal
