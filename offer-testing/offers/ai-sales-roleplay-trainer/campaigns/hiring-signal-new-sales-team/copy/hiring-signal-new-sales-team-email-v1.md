## Email Body

```
Subject: How [Similar Company] cut sales ramp time from 12 weeks to 6

[Name],

Saw you're hiring [2-3 SDRs/AEs] at [Company]. Quick question: how are you planning to get them productive fast?

Most sales leaders I talk to face the same problem:
• New reps need 50-100 practice calls before they're confident
• But managers don't have 10-15 hours/week to roleplay
• So reps "learn on the job" (and burn through real prospects)

We built something different for companies like [Similar Company in their space]:

**Custom AI that acts like their real prospects.**

Here's how it works:
1. We record your top rep's best calls
2. Build AI prospects trained on YOUR buyer objections (not generic scenarios)
3. New reps practice unlimited voice calls with AI
4. AI coach gives feedback based on YOUR playbook

**Result:** Reps make 50 practice calls in Week 1, hit first deal in 6 weeks instead of 12+.

The best part? Takes 2 hours to set up, then it runs 24/7.

Worth a 15-min call to see if this would work for [Company]?

## A/B Test Variations

[Name],

Quick question: how much time do you spend each week roleplaying with your new sales hires?

Most VP Sales tell me 10-15 hours. And they still take 3-4 months to ramp.
