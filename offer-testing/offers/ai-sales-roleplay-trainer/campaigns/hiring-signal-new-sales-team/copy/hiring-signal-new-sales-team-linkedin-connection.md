## Version 1: Direct Signal + Value

```
[Name], saw you're hiring [2-3 SDRs] at [Company]. Built custom AI roleplay for similar companies to cut sales ramp time in half. Worth connecting to share how?
```

**Character count:** ~165 characters

**Pros:**
- References specific signal
- Clear value prop
- Asks permission
- Leaves room for personalization

**Personalization points:**
- Exact number/roles from job posting
- Company name
- Can add mutual connection if exists

---

## Version 2: Peer Reference

```
[Name], helping B2B companies get new sales reps to quota 2x faster with custom AI practice. Saw you're scaling the team at [Company] - worth connecting?
```

**Character count:** ~155 characters

**Pros:**
- Broader value prop (not just hiring signal)
- "scaling the team" = growth-positive framing
- Shorter, punchier

**Cons:**
- Less specific than Version 1

---

## Version 3: Question Format

```
[Name], how are you planning to train your [2-3 new SDRs] at [Company]? Built custom AI roleplay that cuts ramp time in half. Worth connecting?
```

**Character count:** ~150 characters

**Pros:**
- Engages with question
- Specific to their situation
- Clear value

**Cons:**
- Might feel too direct/salesy

---

## Recommended: Version 1

**Why:**
- Most specific (references their exact hiring)
- Balances detail with brevity
- "Similar companies" = social proof
- "Worth connecting?" = soft ask

---

## Personalization Checklist

Before sending, customize:
- [ ] `[Name]` - First name only (keep it casual)
- [ ] `[2-3 SDRs]` - Exact roles/numbers from job posting
- [ ] `[Company]` - Company name

Optional adds (if under 300 chars):
- [ ] Mutual connection: "Also connected with [Mutual Connection]"
- [ ] Industry reference: "...for B2B SaaS companies like [Company]"
- [ ] Specific win: "...cut ramp from 12 weeks to 6"

## What Happens Next

### If They Accept (No Message)
**Wait 24-48 hours**, then send follow-up message (see `hiring-signal-new-sales-team-linkedin-followup.md`)

### If They Accept + Message You
Great! Respond with:
```
Thanks for connecting, [Name]!

Saw the [SDR/AE] openings at [Company]. Most VP Sales I talk to spend 10-15 hours/week training new reps.

We help companies cut that down by building custom AI roleplay apps. New reps practice with AI trained on YOUR buyers and playbook.

Result: Reps hit first deal in 6 weeks instead of 12+.

```

### If They Decline/Ignore
**Don't follow up on LinkedIn**. Try email instead with Version 1 or 2.

## Connection Request Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Reference specific signal (hiring)
- ✅ Be brief (under 200 chars ideal)
- ✅ Offer value, not "pick your brain"
- ✅ Use their company name
- ✅ Ask permission ("worth connecting?")

### DON'T:
- ❌ Send generic template
- ❌ Use all 300 characters (feels like spam)
- ❌ Ask for meeting in connection request
- ❌ Use "I'd love to connect" (everyone says this)
- ❌ Send connection + message at same time (LinkedIn flags it)

---

## Expected Performance

**Acceptance Rate:** 30-40% (strong signal + relevant message)  
**Response Rate:** 10-15% (of acceptances)  
**Most will:** Accept silently, need follow-up

**Why acceptance rates matter:**
- LinkedIn limits: 100-200 connection requests/week
- Once connected, can message unlimited
- First connection = foot in door

---

## A/B Testing Strategy

### Week 1: Test Version 1 vs. Version 2
- Send Version 1 to 25 people
- Send Version 2 to 25 people
- Track acceptance rate

### Week 2: Use winner, test variations
- Try adding industry reference
- Try different value props
- Try question format

### Optimize based on data
- What gets highest acceptance rate?
- What leads to messages vs. silent accepts?

## Notes

- **Best time to send:** Tuesday-Thursday, 9am-11am or 2pm-4pm (recipient's timezone)
- **Frequency:** Max 20 requests/day (LinkedIn safety)
- **Follow-up timing:** Wait 24-48 hours after acceptance before messaging
- **If no response to follow-up:** Try email as second channel
- **Track in Unipile:** Log all connection requests to avoid duplicates
