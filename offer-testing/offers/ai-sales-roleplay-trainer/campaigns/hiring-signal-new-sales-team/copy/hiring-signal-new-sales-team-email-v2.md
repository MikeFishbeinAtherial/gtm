## Email Body

```
Subject: Training 3 new reps without spending 15 hours/week coaching?

[Name],

I noticed you're hiring [specific roles] at [Company]. 

Let me guess what happens next:
• You onboard them with videos and documentation
• They shadow some calls
• Then they're "ready" for real prospects
• But they freeze up on objections they've never practiced
• So you spend 10+ hours/week doing roleplays
• And they still take 3-4 months to hit quota

Sound familiar?

Here's what [VP Sales at Similar Company] did instead:

Built a **custom AI roleplay app** where new reps practice against AI trained to act like their real buyers.

- New hire does 50 practice calls in Week 1 (vs. 0 with traditional training)
- AI throws the same objections they'll face in real calls
- AI coach trained on their winning playbook gives feedback
- Manager time on basic coaching: 2 hours instead of 15

They cut ramp time in half. From 12 weeks to 6 weeks.

We can build this for [Company] in about 2 weeks. Want to see how it works?

[Your Name]
[Your Title]
[Contact Info]

## Key Elements Explained

### Hook (Line 1-2)
"I noticed you're hiring [specific roles] at [Company]. Let me guess what happens next..."

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges the signal
- "Let me guess" = pattern recognition (they feel understood)
- Sets up for problem articulation

### Problem List (Bullet points)
Six-step progression from onboarding → still slow ramp

**Why it works:**
- Specific steps they'll recognize
- Builds progressively ("then... but... so...")
- Ends with the pain: 3-4 months, manager time drain
- "Sound familiar?" = forces mental acknowledgment

### Solution (Lines after "Here's what...")
Peer story with custom AI solution

**Why it works:**
- Specific peer ("VP Sales at...") = credible
- **Bold** on "custom AI roleplay app" = key differentiator
- Four bullet points = easy to scan
- Numbers throughout (50 calls, 2 vs. 15 hours) = concrete

### Impact (Line before CTA)
"They cut ramp time in half. From 12 weeks to 6 weeks."

**Why it works:**
- Short sentence = packs punch
- Specific number = believable
- Simple transformation story

### Call to Action
"We can build this for [Company] in about 2 weeks. Want to see how it works?"

**Why it works:**
- Service angle ("we can build") = done-for-you
- Timeline (2 weeks) = fast implementation
- Soft ask ("want to see") not hard close

## A/B Test Variations

### Variation 2A: Add ROI Math
After "From 12 weeks to 6 weeks" add:
```
That's 6 weeks of extra revenue per rep. At $10K/month quota = $15K per hire.

Plus they freed up 10 hours/week of manager time.
```

### Variation 2B: Start with Question
Replace first paragraph with:
```
[Name],

How much time do you spend each week training your new sales hires?

If you're like most VP Sales, it's 10-15 hours. And they still take 3-4 months to ramp.

I saw you're hiring [roles] at [Company]. There's a better way...
```

### Variation 2C: More Aggressive Agitation
Enhance bullet list with consequences:
```
• You onboard them with videos and documentation (they forget 90%)
• They shadow some calls (but can't ask questions in real-time)
• Then they're "ready" for real prospects (they're not)
• They freeze up on objections (you lose deals)
• So you spend 10+ hours/week doing roleplays (you're exhausted)
• And they still take 3-4 months to hit quota (revenue delayed)
```

## When to Use This Version

**Best for:**
- ✅ Sales leaders feeling overwhelmed with training
- ✅ Companies hiring 2+ roles (pain is acute)
- ✅ Buyers who are problem-aware (know training is hard)
- ✅ Second touch (if no response to Version 1)

- ❌ Companies with enablement teams (they have a solution)
- ❌ Very formal/conservative industries

## Comparison to Version 1

| Aspect | Version 1 (Use Case) | Version 2 (Problem-Agitate-Solve) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Opening** | Question about planning | "Let me guess" scenario |
| **Structure** | Problem → Solution → Impact | Problem → Agitate → Solution |
| **Tone** | Consultative | Empathetic/understanding |
| **Length** | Slightly shorter | Slightly longer (more bullets) |
| **Best for** | Metrics-driven buyers | Pain-driven buyers |

**When in doubt:** Start with Version 1, use Version 2 as follow-up if no response

---

## Expected Performance

**Open Rate:** 35-45% (subject line is direct pain point)  
**Response Rate:** 12-18% (might polarize more than Version 1)  
**Positive Response Rate:** 75-85% of responses (self-selects for high pain)

**Common Positive Responses:**
- "YES - this is exactly our problem"
- "How much does this cost?"
- "We need this yesterday"
- "Can you start next week?"

**Common Objections:**
- "This sounds too good to be true"
- "How do you build it so fast?"
- "What if our buyers are unique?"
- "We tried [competitor], didn't work"

---

## Notes

- **Tone:** Understanding/empathetic, not salesy
- **Length:** ~170 words (45-second read)
- **Key strength:** Articulates pain they're feeling RIGHT NOW
- **Potential weakness:** Might come across as presumptuous with "let me guess" (test and adjust)
- **Follow-up strategy:** If they reply "not interested," ask "is training not a priority or is the timing off?"
