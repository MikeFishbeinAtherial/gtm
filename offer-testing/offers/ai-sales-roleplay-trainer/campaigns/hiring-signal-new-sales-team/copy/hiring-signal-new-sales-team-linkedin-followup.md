## Version 1: Detailed Use Case (Recommended)

```
Hey [Name], 

Quick question about your new [SDR/AE] hires at [Company]:

How are you getting them practice reps before they touch real prospects?

Most sales leaders tell us new reps need 50-100 practice calls to build confidence, but managers don't have time to roleplay.

We solve this by building custom AI that acts like your real buyers. New reps practice unlimited calls with AI trained on YOUR objections and playbook.

Result: Reps hit first deal in 6 weeks instead of 12+.

[Similar Company in their industry] is using it now. Want a quick demo?
```

**Character count:** ~470 characters

**When to use:** 24-48 hours after they accept connection

**Pros:**
- References their specific situation
- Asks engaging question
- Provides clear solution + outcome
- Peer reference (social proof)
- Clear CTA

---

## Version 2: Shorter / Punchier

```
[Name],

Saw you're scaling the sales team at [Company] - congrats on the growth!

[VP Sales at Similar Company] just told me their biggest bottleneck was training new reps fast enough. They were spending 15+ hours/week on roleplays.

They built a custom AI roleplay app with us where:
- New reps practice with AI trained on their real buyer objections
- AI coach gives feedback based on their winning playbook  
- Cut ramp time from 12 weeks to 6

Think this would help at [Company]? Happy to show you how it works.
```

**Character count:** ~510 characters

**When to use:** If they seem senior/busy (C-level), need shorter message

**Pros:**
- Congratulates them (positive framing)
- Peer story format
- Bullet points (easy to scan)
- Soft CTA

---

## Version 3: Question-Led (For Engaged Buyers)

```
[Name],

Thanks for connecting!

I'm curious - with [2-3 new SDRs] joining [Company], what's your plan for getting them productive fast?

The companies we work with face a common challenge:
• New reps need 50-100 practice calls before they're ready
• But managers only have a few hours/week for roleplays
• So reps learn on real prospects (and lose deals)

We build custom AI roleplay apps to solve this. Reps practice unlimited calls with AI trained on your buyers + playbook.

Cuts ramp time in half.

- Clear solution
- Specific CTA (see peer example)

---

## Recommended: Version 1

**Why:**
- Balances detail with brevity
- Engages with question
- Clear value prop
- Not too long for busy buyers

---

## Personalization Checklist

Before sending, customize:
- [ ] `[Name]` - First name
- [ ] `[SDR/AE]` or `[2-3 new SDRs]` - Specific roles from job posting
- [ ] `[Company]` - Company name
- [ ] `[Similar Company in their industry]` - Real peer company (same industry/size)

Optional personalization:
- [ ] Reference something from their profile ("Saw you joined from [Previous Company]")
- [ ] Reference their post ("Loved your post about [Topic]")
- [ ] Reference mutual connection ("Also connected with [Name] on your team")

## Timing Strategy

### Standard Flow
1. **Day 0:** Send connection request
2. **Day 1-2:** They accept (hopefully!)
3. **Day 2-3:** Send follow-up message (this message)
4. **Day 5-7:** If no response, send nudge (see below)

### If They Message You First
Great signal! Respond immediately with:
```
Thanks for reaching out!

Re: your question about [topic they asked], here's the quick version:

[Answer their question]

Want to jump on a quick call to go deeper?
```

## Follow-up Strategy (If No Response)

### Nudge #1 (Day 7 after first message)

```
[Name], following up on my message about sales training.

Bad timing? Or not a priority right now?
```

**Why this works:**
- Short (shows respect for their time)
- Gives them an out
- Often triggers response (guilt factor)

### Nudge #2 (Day 14, if still no response - use Email instead)

Switch channels. Send Email Version 1 with note:
```
Subject: Following up - sales training for [Company]

[Name],

Reached out on LinkedIn but figured email might be easier.

[Email Version 1 body]

Let me know if this is worth exploring.

[Your Name]
```

## Response Handling

### Positive Responses

**If they say:** "Interesting, tell me more"
```
Happy to! Quick question first: how many reps are you planning to hire in next 6 months?

That'll help me show you relevant examples.
```

**If they say:** "Send me more info"
```
Will do! Rather than send a generic deck, can I ask:

1. What's your current sales training process?
2. What's your biggest challenge with new hire ramp?

Want to make sure I send relevant stuff.

Or we can just jump on a 15-min call if that's easier?
```

**If they say:** "What's the pricing?"
```
Depends on team size and complexity. Typically $15-25K setup for custom build.

But ROI is fast - [Similar Company] saved $50K+ in Year 1 (manager time + faster revenue).

Want to see a demo first to make sure it fits?
```

### Objection Responses

**"We already use [Gong/Second Nature]"**
```
Nice! Gong is great for post-call analysis.

This is different - it's for BEFORE real calls. Like a flight simulator for sales.

New reps practice 50+ times with AI before touching prospects. Then Gong helps them improve after.

Complementary tools. Want to see how they work together?
```

**"Not a priority right now"**
```
Totally understand. When are those [new SDRs] starting?

If they're starting soon, timing matters for their ramp. But if it's later, happy to reconnect then.
```

**"Too expensive"**
```
Fair question. Compare to:
- Sales enablement hire: $120K/year
- 6 weeks of lost revenue per rep: $15K each

If you're hiring 3+ reps, ROI is obvious.

Want to see the math for [Company]'s situation?

## LinkedIn Best Practices

### DO:
- ✅ Send 24-48 hours after connection (not immediately)
- ✅ Reference their specific situation
- ✅ Ask questions to engage
- ✅ Keep under 500 characters when possible
- ✅ Include peer references
- ✅ Clear CTA

### DON'T:
- ❌ Send message immediately after connecting (feels automated)
- ❌ Send long paragraphs (hard to read on mobile)
- ❌ Pitch meeting in first message (too pushy)
- ❌ Use salesy language
- ❌ Send follow-ups more than 2x

---

## Expected Performance

**Response Rate:** 20-30% (already connected = warm)  
**Positive Response Rate:** 70-80% of responses  
**Meeting Book Rate:** 40-50% of positive responses

**Timeline:**
- 50 connection requests
- 15-20 acceptances (30-40%)
- 4-6 responses to follow-up (20-30% of accepts)
- 2-3 meetings booked (40-50% of responses)

---

## Notes

- **Tone:** Conversational, not salesy
- **Length:** 400-500 chars (mobile-friendly)
- **Key strength:** Already connected = warmer than cold
- **Follow-up max:** 2 touches on LinkedIn, then switch to email
- **Track in Unipile:** Log all messages to avoid duplicates
- **Safety:** Max 40 messages/day, 2-5 min delays between sends
