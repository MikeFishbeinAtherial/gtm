## Why Use Case-Driven Approach?

**Selected because:**
- ✅ Clear, quantifiable problem (ramp time = 3-6 months)
- ✅ Measurable outcome (cut ramp time in half)
- ✅ Specific implementation (custom AI trained on their playbook)
- ✅ Strong ROI story (manager time + faster revenue)
- ✅ Proven framework (SaaS buyers understand this)

**Not PVP because:** We're selling a service, not giving away insights. Use case shows clear value faster.

**Not Problem-Focused because:** Problem might not feel urgent enough without concrete solution/outcome.

## Use Case #1: Onboarding New Sales Hires

### Situation
**When this applies:**
- Company just hired 2-3 new SDRs or AEs
- Need them productive ASAP (revenue pressure)
- Managers don't have time to roleplay 10+ hours/week
- Traditional training (videos, manuals) isn't preparing reps for real calls

**Target Persona:** VP Sales, Director of Sales managing new hires

### Implementation (Step-by-Step)

**Week 1: Capture Winning Playbook**
1. We record your top rep's 3-5 best calls (discovery, demo, objection handling)
2. Extract their pitch structure, key questions, objection responses
3. Document your ideal buyer personas and common objections

**Week 2: Build Custom AI**
1. Train AI prospects to act like your target buyers
   - Same industry, same objections, same buying signals
   - Voice-based (not text) to mimic real calls
2. Train AI coach on YOUR winning methodology
   - Your discovery framework
   - Your demo flow
   - Your objection handling scripts

**Week 3+: Unlimited Practice**
1. New reps practice 10-15 calls per day with AI
2. AI adapts difficulty (easy prospects → tough objections)
3. AI coach gives specific feedback after each call
4. Managers review AI insights, focus on strategic coaching only

### Impact (Quantified)

| Metric | Before (Traditional Training) | After (AI Roleplay) | Improvement |
|--------|------------------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Practice calls in Week 1** | 0-5 (limited by manager time) | 50+ (unlimited AI) | 10x more reps |
| **Time to first deal** | 12+ weeks | 6 weeks | 2x faster |
| **Manager coaching time** | 10-15 hours/week on basics | 2 hours/week on strategy | 80% time savings |
| **Rep confidence (Week 4)** | 4/10 (nervous on real calls) | 8/10 (practiced 100+ times) | 2x confidence |
| **First month win rate** | 5-10% (learning on the job) | 15-20% (prepared) | 2x win rate |

**ROI Calculation:**
- Manager time saved: 10 hours/week × $100/hour × 52 weeks = **$52,000/year**
- Faster revenue: 6 weeks faster ramp × $10K/month quota = **$15,000 per rep**
- 3 new reps = **$45,000 faster revenue**
- **Total first-year value: $97,000**
- Setup cost: ~$15-25K (service fee)
- **ROI: 4-6x in Year 1**

### Proof Points
- "Sales leaders spend 10-15 hours/week coaching basics that AI could handle" (industry stat)
- "Average sales rep ramp time: 3-6 months" (common knowledge)
- "Reps need 50-100 practice calls to build confidence" (sales training principle)

## Use Case #2: Scaling Sales Team Without Scaling Manager Time

### Situation
**When this applies:**
- Company planning to hire 5-10 sales reps in next 6 months
- VP Sales can't scale their coaching (only 40 hours/week)
- Don't want to hire expensive Sales Enablement person yet ($120K+ salary)
- Need consistent training quality across growing team

**Target Persona:** CRO, VP Sales at scaling companies

### Implementation

**Phase 1: Systematize Winning Approach**
1. Document what makes your top reps successful
2. Create standardized playbook (what to say, when, how)
3. Build AI trained on THIS playbook (not generic best practices)

**Phase 2: Deploy Scalable Training**
1. Every new rep gets same AI coach (consistent training)
2. AI available 24/7 (no scheduling conflicts)
3. Each rep gets personalized feedback on THEIR performance

**Phase 3: Manager as Strategic Coach**
1. AI handles repetitive basics (pitch practice, objection drills)
2. Managers focus on deals, strategy, motivation
3. Scale from 5 reps to 15 reps without hiring enablement

### Impact (Quantified)

| Metric | Without AI (Manual Coaching) | With AI (Scaled Training) | Improvement |
|--------|----------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Reps per manager** | 5-7 (limited by coaching time) | 12-15 (AI handles basics) | 2x capacity |
| **Enablement headcount** | Need to hire at 10+ reps ($120K) | Delay until 20+ reps | $120K saved |
| **Training consistency** | Varies by manager | Same quality for everyone | Standardized |
| **Manager time freed** | 0 (at capacity) | 20+ hours/week | Focus on strategy |

**ROI Calculation:**
- Avoid enablement hire: **$120K/year salary saved**
- Manager productivity: 20 hours/week × $100/hour × 52 weeks = **$104,000/year**
- Scale capacity: Manage 15 reps instead of 7 = **2x revenue potential**
- **Total value: $220K+ per year**

### Proof Points
- "Sales managers can effectively coach 5-7 reps" (industry standard)
- "Sales Enablement roles cost $100-150K" (salary benchmarks)
- "Inconsistent coaching = inconsistent results" (common pain)

## Messaging Hierarchy

### Hook (First Line)
**Purpose:** Get attention with their specific situation

**Examples:**
- "Saw you're hiring [2-3 SDRs] at [Company]..."
- "Congrats on the [Series A/new hires] - how are you planning to train them?"
- "Quick question about your new [sales hires]..."

### Context (Problem Setup)
**Purpose:** Show you understand their world

**Formula:** "Most [buyer persona] I talk to face [problem]..."

**Example:**
"Most VP Sales tell me:
- New reps need 50-100 practice calls before they're confident
- But managers don't have 15 hours/week to roleplay
- So reps 'learn on the job' and burn through real prospects"

### Solution (Use Case)
**Purpose:** Show specific implementation

**Formula:** "Here's what [similar company] did..."

**Example:**
"[Similar Company] built a custom AI roleplay app where:
- New reps practice with AI trained on their real buyer objections
- AI coach gives feedback based on their winning playbook
- Result: Cut ramp time from 12 weeks to 6"

### Impact (Quantified Outcome)
**Purpose:** Make it concrete and believable

**Formula:** "[Metric] improved from [before] to [after]"

**Example:**
"Reps make 50 practice calls in Week 1, hit first deal in 6 weeks instead of 12+"

### Call to Action
**Purpose:** Low-friction next step

**Formula:** "Worth a [time] call to see if this would work for [Company]?"

**Example:**
- "Worth a 15-min call to see how this would work for [Company]?"
- "Want to see a quick demo?"
- "Does this sound relevant for your team?"

## Key Differentiators to Emphasize

| Feature | Why It Matters | How to Phrase |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| **Custom-trained** | Not generic scenarios | "AI trained on YOUR buyers and playbook" |
| **Voice-based** | Mimics real calls | "Voice calls, not text chatbots" |
| **Service not product** | No setup burden | "We build it for you in 2 weeks" |
| **Personalized coaching** | Improves each rep | "AI coach analyzes performance, gives specific tips" |
| **Manager time savings** | Clear ROI | "2 hours instead of 15 hours/week coaching" |

---

## Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"Too expensive"** | "Compare to $120K enablement hire or 6 weeks of lost revenue per rep" |
| **"We use [Gong/generic tool]"** | "Gong shows what happened, we let them practice BEFORE real calls" |
| **"Reps need real practice"** | "They do - after 50 AI practice calls. Then they're ready for real prospects" |
| **"Not a priority right now"** | "When are those [2 new hires] starting? Timeline matters for their ramp" |
| **"Need to think about it"** | "Makes sense. Want me to show you what we built for [Similar Company]?" |

## Tone & Voice

**Be:** Direct, helpful, consultative  
**Not:** Salesy, pushy, generic

- Numbers and metrics
- Peer references ("VP Sales at [Company]...")
- Questions to engage

**Avoid:**
- Buzzwords ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- Vague claims ("improve performance")
- Long paragraphs
- Talking about yourself

---

## Success Metrics

- Positive responses: 80%+ (not "not interested")

**Conversion Metrics:**

## Notes

- **Strengths:** Clear ROI story, specific implementation, quantified impact
- **Risks:** Might sound too good to be true (need proof points)
- **Iteration:** Can soften numbers if skepticism comes up, or add more peer examples
