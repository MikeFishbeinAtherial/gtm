## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors
- **AI Consulting Firms** (e.g., Slalom, Accenture AI)
  - Positioning: Enterprise-focused, strategy + implementation
  - Weakness: Slow, expensive, focused on Fortune 500
  - Our Edge: Faster, focused on growth-stage companies, production code

- **AI Development Agencies**
  - Positioning: Custom AI development
  - Weakness: Often lack production experience, focus on prototypes
  - Our Edge: Production-grade systems, experienced engineers

  - Our Edge: Full team, faster delivery, maintained systems

### Indirect Competitors
- **Off-the-shelf AI Tools** (ChatGPT, Zapier AI, etc.)
  - When they work: Simple, generic use cases
  - When they don't: Custom workflows, complex logic, integration needs

- **In-house Development**
  - When it works: Companies with AI engineering teams
  - When it doesn't: Most companies lack AI expertise or capacity

## Market Insights

## Notes

### Positioning Insights
- "Production-ready" is key differentiator (vs. prototypes/demos)
- Speed matters (weeks not months)
- Show portfolio early (atherial.ai/work)
- Emphasize we're developers, not consultants

### Target Buyer Journey
1. Awareness: "We should do something with AI"
2. Research: "What's possible? What's the right approach?"
3. Evaluation: "Build vs. buy vs. hire vs. outsource"
4. Decision: "This vendor can deliver what we need"

### Best Entry Points
- Recent funding (budget for AI initiatives)
- Hiring for AI roles (shows intent, haven't filled yet)
- New operations/product roles (shows growth, need for tools)
- 1st-degree connections (warm intros, referrals)
