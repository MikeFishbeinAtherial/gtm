## Quick Summary

Atherial builds custom AI agents and internal tools that go into production. We help companies automate workflows and ship AI features without hiring an entire AI engineering team. Target buyers are CEOs, CTOs, and VP-level leaders at growth-stage companies ($2M+ ARR) who recognize AI opportunities but lack in-house expertise.

**Key Differentiator:** We ship production code, not consulting decks.

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Launch networking-holidays-2025 campaign (539 1st-degree LinkedIn connections)
2. Monitor results and response rate
3. Gather learnings for future campaigns
4. Consider signal-based outbound campaigns (hiring signals, tech stack changes)
