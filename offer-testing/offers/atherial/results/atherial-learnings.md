## Networking Campaign Learnings (networking-holidays-2025)

### Test Results from Eugene Send
- ✅ Successfully sent test message to Eugene Leychenko
- ✅ Unipile API works for sending LinkedIn DMs
- ✅ No errors or LinkedIn warnings
- ⏳ Waiting for response to evaluate message effectiveness

### What to Track
1. **Response Rate** - What % of 539 contacts reply?
2. **Response Types** - Engaged, interested, referral, decline, none
3. **Referral Quality** - Do intros lead to qualified meetings?
4. **Timing Patterns** - Which days/times get best response?
5. **LinkedIn Safety** - Any errors, warnings, or account issues?
6. **Message Fatigue** - Does response rate drop as campaign progresses?

### Hypotheses to Test
- **H1:** Holiday timing increases response rate (vs. normal outreach)
- **H2:** 1st-degree connections respond at 15%+ rate
- **H3:** Referral ask performs better than direct pitch
- **H4:** 50 messages/day is safe and sustainable
- **H5:** Portfolio link increases credibility and engagement

### Questions to Answer
1. Should we do a follow-up message to non-responders?
2. What's the best way to convert replies into meetings?
3. Can we identify patterns in who responds vs. who doesn't?
4. Should we segment future campaigns by industry or role?
5. What's the optimal sending rate for LinkedIn safety?

## Action Items

### Immediate (During Campaign)
- [ ] Monitor daily send progress
- [ ] Track reply rate by day
- [ ] Respond quickly to engaged replies
- [ ] Flag any LinkedIn errors/warnings
- [ ] Document any A/B test ideas

### Post-Campaign Analysis
- [ ] Calculate final reply rate
- [ ] Categorize response types
- [ ] Identify patterns (industry, role, timing)
- [ ] Document referrals generated
- [ ] Calculate meetings booked
- [ ] Assess LinkedIn safety (any issues?)

### Future Campaign Ideas
- [ ] Test signal-based outbound (hiring, funding, tech stack)
- [ ] Build follow-up sequences
- [ ] Create industry-specific messaging
- [ ] Test different CTAs (calendar link, case study, demo)
- [ ] Experiment with timing (day of week, time of day)
