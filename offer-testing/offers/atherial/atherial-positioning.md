## 1. Category Definition

**Category:** Custom AI Development Services

**Differentiation:** Production-ready AI agents and internal tools built by experienced developers, not consultants or templates.

## 2. Target Customer (ICP)

### Company Profile
- **Size:** 20-500 employees
- **Industry:** Industry-agnostic (any company with complex internal workflows or customer interactions)
- **Stage:** Growth stage or established
- **Geography:** United States
- **Revenue:** $2M+ ARR
- **Key Requirement:** Leadership recognizes AI opportunity but lacks in-house expertise

### Buyer Profile
- **Primary Buyers:** CEO, CTO, VP of Operations, VP of Product
- **Department:** Engineering, Operations, Product
- **Seniority:** C-level, VP, Director

## 3. Customer Problem

**The Problem:**  
Companies see AI opportunities but don't have the technical talent to build production-grade AI systems. Off-the-shelf solutions are too generic, and hiring an AI team is too expensive/slow.

**Who Feels It Most:**  
- **CEOs:** Pressure to adopt AI before competitors
- **CTOs:** Backlog of AI ideas but no capacity to build them
- **Ops Leaders:** Manual processes that AI could automate

**What Happens If They Don't Solve It:**
- Fall behind competitors who ship AI faster
- Continue wasting time on manual work
- Miss revenue opportunities from AI-powered features

**How They Describe It (Their Words):**
- "We want to use AI but don't know where to start"
- "We tried building it ourselves but hit technical walls"
- "We need something custom, not another generic chatbot"
- "Our team is too busy to learn AI development"

## 4. Benefits & Outcomes

- **Immediate (Week 1):** Clear roadmap of what AI can do for your business
- **Short-term (30-90 days):** First AI agent or tool in production, saving hours/week
- **Long-term (6-12 months):** Multiple AI systems running, measurable ROI, competitive advantage

## 5. Current Alternatives

| Alternative | Pros | Cons |
|------------|------|------|
| **Hire AI Engineers** | Full control, in-house | Expensive ($200K+/year), slow to hire, hard to retain |
| **AI Agencies/Consultants** | Strategy and planning | Often don't build production code, focus on slides not systems |
| **Off-the-shelf Tools** | Quick setup, cheap | Generic, limited customization, doesn't fit unique workflows |
| **Build In-House** | Full ownership | Requires AI expertise team doesn't have, diverts resources |

**Why Current Solutions Aren't Good Enough:**  
Most companies need custom AI that fits their unique workflows, but hiring/building is too slow and expensive. Consultants talk strategy but don't ship code. Off-the-shelf tools force you to change your processes to fit their product.

## 6. One-Line Positioning

**Selected Version:**  
"We build custom AI agents and internal tools that go into production, so you can automate workflows and ship AI features without hiring an entire AI team."

**Alternative Versions:**
- "Unlike AI consultants who deliver strategy decks, Atherial ships production-ready AI code for companies who need custom solutions fast."
- "Companies use Atherial to turn AI ideas into working systems in weeks, not months."

## 7. Key Differentiators

| Differentiator | Why It Matters |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Production Code, Not Consulting** | We ship working systems, not recommendations |
| **Fast Iteration** | Working prototype in weeks, not quarters |
| **Custom to Your Workflows** | Built for your specific processes, not generic templates |
| **Experienced Developers** | Real engineering team with AI + production experience |

## 8. Proof Points

| Proof Type | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Portfolio** | Demo videos at atherial.ai/work |
| **Case Studies** | AI agents and tools shipped to production |
| **Technical Expertise** | Custom AI development, not no-code tools |
| **Speed** | Prototypes in weeks, production in months |

## Notes

- **Type:** Service
- **Owner:** Internal (Atherial)
- **Best Signals for Outreach:** 
  - Companies hiring for AI roles (shows intent but hasn't filled position yet)
  - Companies with new operations/product roles (shows growth, need for tooling)
  - 1st-degree connections (networking, warm intros)
- **Campaign Focus:** This first campaign is networking-focused (reconnecting with connections, holiday wishes, soft referral ask)
