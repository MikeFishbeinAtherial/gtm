## Quick Summary

**What:** Custom AI development services and RBI product for financial firms who need AI capabilities but can't afford Citadel-scale infrastructure.

**Who:** 
- Small-to-Mid Hedge Funds ($10M-$500M AUM) - CIO/Head of Research, CTO, Founding Partner
- Mid-Market Private Equity Firms ($100M-$2B AUM) - Partner/Managing Director, Head of Technology, Managing Partner

**Problem:** 
- Hedge Funds: LPs expect AI capabilities but can't afford $2M-$10M AI teams. Manual research can't compete with Citadel-scale AI.
- PE Firms: Traditional sourcing only reaches 16.5% of relevant deals. Investment banks show same deals to 10 firms. Can't compete with Blackstone/EQT's proprietary AI sourcing.

**Differentiator:** Custom AI solutions + RBI product that provide proprietary edge and Citadel-level capabilities at fraction of mega-fund costs.

**Lead Magnet Examples:**
- "3 prediction market signals that outperformed S&P by 12% in 2024"
- "The earnings call sentiment edge that 80% of Balyasny's staff use daily"
- "How funds front-ran Fed decisions by 48 hours using Polymarket data"
