## 1. Category Definition

**Category:** AI-Powered Financial Intelligence & Deal Sourcing  
**Your Position:** Custom AI Development for Financial Firms (service) + RBI Product

**How we're different:**  
Unlike generic financial data platforms or off-the-shelf AI tools, we provide custom AI development services specifically for hedge funds and PE firms, plus a proprietary RBI (Research-Based Intelligence) product. We help firms compete with Citadel-scale AI capabilities without needing their infrastructure budget.

## 3. Customer Problem

**The Problem:**  
Financial firms are caught between two realities: (1) LPs and investors expect AI-powered capabilities and data-driven insights, but (2) they can't afford Citadel-scale AI teams and infrastructure. Manual research processes can't compete with funds running sophisticated LLMs and AI systems, leading to missed opportunities and competitive disadvantages.

**Who Feels It Most:**

**For Hedge Funds:**
- **CIO/Head of Research:** Responsible for generating alpha and research quality, but lacks AI resources
- **Founding Partners:** Feel pressure from LPs to demonstrate AI capabilities, but budget constraints limit options
- **CTO:** Knows what's possible with AI but can't justify massive infrastructure spend

**For PE Firms:**
- **Partners/Managing Directors:** Frustrated that traditional sourcing only reaches 16.5% of relevant deals
- **Deal Teams:** Spending weeks manually researching companies that AI could identify in 48 hours
- **Founding Partners:** Watching Blackstone/EQT use proprietary AI sourcing engines while they're stuck with investment banks showing the same deals to 10 other firms

**What Happens If They Don't Solve It:**
- **Hedge Funds:**
  - Underperformance vs. AI-powered competitors
  - LP redemptions due to perceived lack of innovation
  - Missed trading opportunities that AI could have identified
  - Research team burnout from manual processes
  - Inability to compete for top talent who want to work with cutting-edge tools

- **PE Firms:**
  - Missing 80%+ of relevant deals (only seeing 16.5% through traditional channels)
  - Paying premium prices for deals everyone else sees (no proprietary edge)
  - Slower deal execution (weeks vs. days with AI)
  - Lower deal quality due to limited sourcing options
  - Competitive disadvantage vs. mega-funds with AI capabilities

**How They Describe It (Their Words):**
- "We can't compete with Citadel's AI team"
- "Our LPs are asking what we're doing with AI"
- "Investment banks show us the same deals as everyone else"
- "We're missing deals we should have found"
- "Our research team is drowning in manual work"
- "We need AI capabilities but can't afford a 50-person AI team"
- "Blackstone has proprietary sourcing engines - we're stuck with Excel"

## 5. Current Alternatives

| Alternative | Pros | Cons |
|-------------|------|------|
| **Build internal AI team** | Full control, tailored to needs | Extremely expensive ($2M-$10M+ annually), long time to value (12-24 months), hard to hire AI talent |
| **Generic financial data platforms (Bloomberg, FactSet)** | Established, comprehensive data | Expensive, everyone has same data (no edge), limited AI capabilities, not customizable |
| **Off-the-shelf AI tools** | Lower cost, faster to implement | Generic, not tailored to financial use cases, no proprietary edge, limited customization |
| **Investment banks (for PE)** | Relationships, deal flow | Same deals as 10 other firms, expensive fees, no proprietary advantage, limited to their network |
| **Manual research processes** | Low cost, familiar | Can't compete with AI-powered competitors, slow (weeks vs. days), limited to human capacity, error-prone |
| **Outsource to consultants** | No internal team needed | Expensive, not ongoing, limited customization, knowledge leaves with consultant |

**Why Current Solutions Aren't Good Enough:**  
None provide the combination of (1) AI-powered capabilities that compete with mega-funds, (2) affordability for mid-market firms, (3) customization for specific use cases, and (4) proprietary edge vs. competitors. Building internally is too expensive; buying generic tools provides no competitive advantage; manual processes can't scale.

## 6. One-Line Positioning

**Selected Version:**  
"We help small-to-mid hedge funds and PE firms who can't afford Citadel-scale AI teams but need AI capabilities to compete by providing custom AI development and RBI products, so they can access proprietary insights and deal flow without massive infrastructure investment."

**Alternative Versions:**

- **Problem-led:** "Unlike mega-funds with $10M AI budgets, mid-market financial firms struggle to compete. We provide custom AI development and RBI products so CIOs and Partners can access Citadel-level capabilities at a fraction of the cost."

- **Outcome-led:** "CIOs and PE Partners use our custom AI development and RBI products to access proprietary deal flow and research insights that compete with Blackstone and Citadel, without building 50-person AI teams."
