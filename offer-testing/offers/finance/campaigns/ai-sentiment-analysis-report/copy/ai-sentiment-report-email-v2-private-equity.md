## Email Body

**Subject: diligence shortcut**

Most PE teams spend weeks manually reading Glassdoor and Reddit during diligence.

We built AI that does this in 20 minutes. It pulls employee sentiment, customer complaints, franchisee chatter—analyzes thousands of posts to flag culture issues, service decline, or growth signals before you sign.

Vista's team used it on a QSR deal and caught franchisee disputes that weren't in management presentations.

I'll run a free sentiment analysis on any brand you're looking at. You get sentiment scores, trend charts, key themes.

## P.S. Addition (Optional)

## Personalization Notes

- **Vertical:** Adjust examples based on their focus (QSR, retail, franchises, consumer brands)
