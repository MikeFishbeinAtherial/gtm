{FirstName},

Most funds miss sentiment shifts before earnings season hits.

Reddit, Glassdoor, etc light up 2-3 months before bad quarters. By the time earnings drop, you're late.

AI can auto-analyze this for public and private companies. Panera analysts caught sentiment collapse 18 days before the earnings miss using this approach.

Still open if you want a sentiment read on any consumer name before earnings.

Takes 20 mins to run, zero strings.
