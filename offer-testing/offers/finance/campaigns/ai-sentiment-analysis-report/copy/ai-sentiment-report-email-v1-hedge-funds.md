## Email Body

**Subject: earnings prep**

Most funds miss sentiment shifts before earnings season hits.

Reddit, Glassdoor, forums light up 2-3 weeks before bad quarters. By the time earnings drop, you're late.

We built AI that auto-analyzes this for consumer stocks. Panera analysts at Cowen caught sentiment collapse 18 days before the earnings miss.

I'll send you a free sentiment report on any consumer brand you're watching this quarter. Takes me 20 minutes to run—shows sentiment scores, volume trends, key themes.

Want one? Just reply with the ticker.

- **{Ticker}:** If you know they cover specific consumer stocks, mention in P.S.: "P.S. Happy to run Target or Chipotle if that's helpful"
- **Timing:** Send 2-4 weeks before earnings season (Q4 earnings = mid Jan)
