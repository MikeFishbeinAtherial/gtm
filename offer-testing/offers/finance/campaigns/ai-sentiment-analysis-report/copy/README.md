## Key Principles (From Skill Guide)

### Subject Lines
- **1-3 words max** (e.g., "earnings prep", "diligence shortcut")
- **Mystery > clarity** (make them curious)
- **Problem-focused** (not generic "Quick question")

### Email Structure (5 Sentences Max)
1. **Opening Hook** - Jump straight into problem (no greeting fluff)
2. **Problem Context** - Quantify the pain (e.g., "2-3 weeks before bad quarters")
3. **Social Proof** - Company name + outcome (e.g., "Panera analysts at Cowen caught...")
4. **The Offer** - Concrete deliverable (e.g., "sentiment scores, volume trends, key themes")
5. **Easy CTA + Detach** - Simple ask with an out (e.g., "Want one? Just reply.")

### Style Rules
**DO:**
- Casual words ("wanna", "you're")
- Short, punchy sentences
- Make them feel FOMO or curiosity

**DON'T:**
- AI-sounding phrases
- Over-personalize with irrelevant details
- Use emoji (unless they do)
- Include links in first email
- Go over 5 sentences
- Use corporate speak

---

## Social Proof Used

### Real Examples:
- **Panera at Cowen** - Sentiment collapse caught 18 days before earnings miss
- **Vista's QSR deal** - Caught franchisee disputes not in management presentations
- **KKR consumer team** - Culture issues caught 6 months before hitting financials

### Why These Work:
- Name-drops respected firms (Cowen, Vista, KKR)
- Specific timeframes (18 days, 6 months)
- Concrete outcomes (caught issues, saved deals)

---

## Personalization Variables

All templates support:
- **{FirstName}** - Contact's first name
- **{YourName}** - Your name/signature
- **{FirmName}** - Their firm (optional, use in P.S.)
- **{Ticker}** - If you know stocks they cover
- **{Role}** - Adjust framing based on role

---

## Follow-up Strategy

**Timing:** 3 days after initial email (not 5-7 days)

**Structure:**
- Even shorter than initial email (1-2 sentences)
- Restate the offer simply
- Add "zero strings" or "no worries if timing's off"

**Example:**
```
Subject: Re: earnings prep

Still open if you want a sentiment read on any consumer name before earnings.

Takes 20 mins to run, zero strings.

Best,
Mike
```

## A/B Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: Subject Lines
- "earnings prep" vs. "consumer signals" vs. "Reddit sentiment"
- Hypothesis: Mystery-driven ("earnings prep") beats descriptive

### Test 2: Offer Type
- Custom report vs. Practical guide vs. Choice between both
- Hypothesis: Choice (Template 3) gets more replies but lower conversion

### Test 3: Social Proof
- Specific firm name (Cowen, Vista) vs. Generic ("hedge fund", "PE firm")
- Hypothesis: Name-drops increase credibility and reply rate
