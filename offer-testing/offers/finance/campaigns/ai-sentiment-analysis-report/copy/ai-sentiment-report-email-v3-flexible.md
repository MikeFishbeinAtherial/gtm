## Email Body

**Subject: AI for sentiment**

Manual sentiment analysis on Reddit, Glassdoor, RepVue takes days.

AI does it in minutes, at scale, and catches things humans miss. 

KKR's consumer team used it to monitor portfolio companies. Caught culture issues 6 months before they hit financials.

I can send you one of two things:
1. **Free sentiment report** on any company (public or private)
2. **Practical guide** with prompts + templates to run this yourself

Which one helps more? Just reply.

Best,

Mike
