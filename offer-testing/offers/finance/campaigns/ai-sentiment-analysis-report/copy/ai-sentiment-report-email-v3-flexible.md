## Email Body

**Subject: AI for sentiment**

Manual sentiment analysis on Reddit, Glassdoor, forums takes days.

AI does it in minutes—and catches things humans miss. We built tools that auto-analyze employee reviews, customer complaints, franchisee chatter for early risk/opportunity signals.

KKR's consumer team used it to monitor portfolio companies. Caught culture issues 6 months before they hit financials.

I can send you one of two things:
1. **Free sentiment report** on any company (public or private)
2. **Practical guide** with prompts + templates to run this yourself

Which one helps more? Just reply.

Best,

## P.S. Addition (Optional)
