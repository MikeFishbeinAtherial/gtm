Subject: sourcing edge

{FirstName},

Most PE firms find distressed assets after everyone else sees the trouble.

AI catches employee sentiment collapse, customer dissatisfaction, operational issues months before they hit financials or show up in broker decks.

We built a guide showing how to monitor thousands of companies simultaneously for early distress signals using AI sentiment analysis.

A PE firm used this to source 3 deals before they went to market.

Want it? Just reply yes and I'll send it to you.

Best,
Mike
