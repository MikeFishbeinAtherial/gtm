## Email Body

Subject: diligence shortcut

{FirstName},

Most PE teams spend weeks manually reading Glassdoor and Reddit during diligence.

AI does this in 20 minutes. Employee sentiment, customer complaints, franchisee chatter—analyzes thousands of posts to flag culture issues, service decline, or growth signals before you sign.

Vista's team caught franchisee disputes on a QSR deal that weren't in management presentations.

Want a free guide on how to get AI to do this automatically for every deal you're evaluating? Just reply yes and I'll send it to you.

Best,

Mike
