{FirstName},

Manual monitoring of portfolio company health takes weeks.

AI does it in hours. Employee reviews, customer feedback, online chatter—analyzes thousands of posts to catch culture issues, service decline, or growth signals 6 months before they hit financials.

KKR's consumer team uses this for portfolio monitoring.

Want a free guide on how to get AI to do this automatically for every portfolio company? Just reply yes and I'll send it to you.

Best,
Mike
