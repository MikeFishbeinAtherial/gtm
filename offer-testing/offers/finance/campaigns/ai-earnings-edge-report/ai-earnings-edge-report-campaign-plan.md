## Signals (See `ai-earnings-edge-report-signals.md` for details)

**Primary Signal Stack: "Research-Focused Fund"**
1. ✅ Hiring research analysts or quantitative researchers (last 30 days) - **HIGH PRIORITY**
2. ✅ Fund mentions AI/ML initiatives or data science in job postings - **HIGH PRIORITY**
3. ✅ Fund size $10M-$500M AUM (hedge funds) or $100M-$2B (PE) - **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Secondary Signal Stack: "Manual Research Process"**
1. Fund posts about reading transcripts or earnings calls manually - MEDIUM PRIORITY
2. Fund mentions competitive challenges with larger funds - MEDIUM PRIORITY
3. Fund hiring technology or data roles - MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Why these signals:**
- Funds hiring research roles are actively building research capabilities
- Mentioning AI/ML shows awareness of technology needs
- Mid-market size = can't afford Citadel-scale teams but need to compete
- Manual research mentions = pain point we solve
