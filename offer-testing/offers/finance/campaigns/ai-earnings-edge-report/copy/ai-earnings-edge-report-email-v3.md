## Email Body

Subject: build earnings AI

{FirstName},

Most funds analyze earnings calls one at a time.

What if AI could do it for every company in your portfolio simultaneously?

We built a guide showing how to set this up yourself. No vendor dependency, runs on your schedule, scales to hundreds of companies.

A hedge fund used this approach and improved earnings prediction accuracy 23%.

Want it? Just reply "send guide".

Best,
Mike
