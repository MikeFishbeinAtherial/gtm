## Follow-up Message Options

### Version 1: Direct Report Offer (RECOMMENDED)

Hi {FirstName}, thanks for connecting.

I just finished a report on AI earnings analysis that most funds don't know exists. It shows how LLMs extract sentiment signals from earnings calls - signals that predict earnings surprises better than consensus estimates.

The report covers:
- The sentiment signal that beats consensus
- How LLM-extracted management tone predicts surprises
- Real examples from 4 mid-market funds we've worked with

We've helped funds improve earnings surprise prediction accuracy by 23%. Want the report? Just say yes and I'll send it over - no pitch, just insights.

### Version 2: Use Case Focus

Hi {FirstName}, thanks for connecting.

Quick question: Are you exploring AI for research to compete with larger funds?

I have a free report showing how sentiment analysis can improve earnings surprise predictions. One fund we worked with saw 23% improvement in accuracy using our LLM approach.

Want it? Just reply and I'll send it over.
