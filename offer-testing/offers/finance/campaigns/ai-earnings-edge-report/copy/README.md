## A/B Testing Strategy

### Test 1: Offer Type
- **Version 1** (custom report) vs. **Version 3** (guide)
- Hypothesis: Custom report gets fewer replies but higher quality
- Track: Reply rate, meeting rate, conversion to opportunity

### Test 2: Subject Lines
Within each version, test subject variations:
- "earnings call edge" vs. "Citadel's LLM advantage" vs. "reading transcripts manually?"
- Hypothesis: Problem-focused ("reading transcripts manually?") beats benefit-focused

### Test 3: Social Proof
- Specific fund size ($180M, $240M) vs. Generic ("mid-market fund")
- Hypothesis: Specific numbers build more credibility

## Personalization Options

All templates support:

- **{FundSize}** - Adjust social proof ($180M, $240M, etc.)

**Minimal personalization works best:**

## Follow-up Strategy

**Timing:** 3 days (not 5-7 days)

**Rules:**
- Even shorter than initial email (1-2 sentences)
- Restate the offer simply
- Add "zero strings" or "no worries if timing's off"
- Keep same subject line (thread continuity)

**Example (V1):**
```
Subject: Re: earnings call edge

Still open if you want an LLM earnings analysis on any name.

15 mins to run, no strings.

Best,
Mike
```
