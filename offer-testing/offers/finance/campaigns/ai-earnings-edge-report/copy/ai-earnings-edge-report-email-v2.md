Hi {FirstName},

There's a sentiment signal in earnings calls that most funds are missing.

While you're reading transcripts looking for management tone changes, LLMs can extract this signal automatically - and it predicts earnings surprises better than consensus estimates.

**Here's what we've seen:**
- Funds using AI sentiment analysis saw 8% alpha improvement in earnings-driven trades
- One fund improved earnings surprise prediction accuracy by 23% using our LLM approach
- The management tone in earnings calls - how they answer questions, what they emphasize - is a signal most funds aren't capturing

I just finished a report called "The AI Earnings Edge Report" that shows:
- The sentiment signal that beats consensus estimates
- How LLM-extracted management tone predicts earnings surprises
- Real examples from funds we've worked with
- A playbook on leveraging AI for research without building a 50-person team

We've helped 4 mid-market funds ($50M-$300M AUM) build AI earnings analysis systems. The report shares what we learned.

Want it? Just reply and I'll send it over - no pitch, just insights.

Best,
{YourName}
