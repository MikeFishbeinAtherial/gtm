## Email Body

Subject: AI for earnings

{FirstName},

Manual earnings call analysis takes hours per company.

AI does it in seconds and catches alpha humans miss. Management tone, answer patterns, topic avoidance all signal surprises before they hit.

A hedge fund improved earnings prediction accuracy 23% using AI analysis.

Want a free guide on how to get AI to do this on thousands of companies automatically, immediately after earnings? Just reply yes and I'll send it to you.

Best,
Mike
