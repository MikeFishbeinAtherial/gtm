**Subject: While Citadel runs LLMs on earnings calls, you're reading transcripts manually**

Hi {FirstName},

While Citadel and Two Sigma run LLMs on earnings calls to extract sentiment and predict surprises, most mid-market funds are still reading transcripts manually.

**The gap:**
- Mega-funds use AI to analyze earnings calls in minutes
- You're spending hours reading transcripts looking for signals
- They're faster, more accurate, and catching insights you're missing

**The opportunity:**
LLMs can extract sentiment signals that predict earnings surprises better than consensus estimates. The management tone in earnings calls - how they answer questions, what they emphasize, what they avoid - is a signal most funds aren't capturing.

I just finished a report called "The AI Earnings Edge Report" that shows:
- How LLM-extracted management tone predicts earnings surprises
- The sentiment signal that beats consensus estimates
- Real examples from funds we've worked with
- How to leverage AI for research without building a 50-person team

We've helped 4 mid-market funds ($50M-$300M AUM) build AI earnings analysis systems. One fund improved earnings surprise prediction accuracy by 23%.

Want the report? Just reply and I'll send it over - no pitch, just insights.

Best,

Hi {FirstName},

Following up on my note about AI earnings analysis.

The report shows how funds are using LLMs to extract sentiment signals from earnings calls - signals that predict earnings surprises better than consensus estimates. One fund we worked with improved prediction accuracy by 23%.
