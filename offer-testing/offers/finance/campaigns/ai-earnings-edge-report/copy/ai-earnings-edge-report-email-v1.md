## Email Body

Subject: earnings call edge

{FirstName},

Citadel and Two Sigma run AI on earnings calls to catch sentiment shifts in minutes.

Most mid-market funds spend hours reading transcripts manually and miss the signals. Management tone—how they answer, what they dodge—predicts surprises better than consensus.

A hedge fund caught sentiment collapse 21 days before an earnings miss using AI analysis.

I'll run a free earnings call analysis on any stock you're watching. You get sentiment scores, management tone shifts, key themes.

Mike
