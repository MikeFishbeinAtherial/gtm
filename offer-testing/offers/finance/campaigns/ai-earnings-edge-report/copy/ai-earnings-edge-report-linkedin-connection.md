## Connection Request Options

### Version 1: Direct Offer (RECOMMENDED)

Hi {FirstName}, I noticed {FundName} is building out research capabilities. I just finished a report on how funds use AI to extract sentiment signals from earnings calls - predicts surprises better than consensus. Happy to share if useful.

---

### Version 2: Signal Reference

Hi {FirstName}, I saw {FundName} is hiring research analysts. I have a free report on AI earnings analysis - shows how LLMs predict earnings surprises better than consensus estimates. Interested?

---

### Version 3: Competitive Angle

Hi {FirstName}, While Citadel uses LLMs on earnings calls, most mid-market funds read transcripts manually. I have a free report showing the sentiment signal that beats consensus. Want it?
