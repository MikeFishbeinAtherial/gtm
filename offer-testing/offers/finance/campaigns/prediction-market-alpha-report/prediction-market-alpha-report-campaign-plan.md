## Notes

- **Why this campaign:** Prediction markets are novel and demonstrate proprietary data edge
- **Target audience:** Non-technical decision makers (CIOs, Partners) who want insights, not technical implementation
- **Key differentiator:** Most funds don't know about prediction market data - this is educational and valuable
- **Risk:** May be too niche if funds aren't familiar with prediction markets
- **Mitigation:** Frame as "alternative data source" and "real-time probability data" rather than technical "Polymarket API"
