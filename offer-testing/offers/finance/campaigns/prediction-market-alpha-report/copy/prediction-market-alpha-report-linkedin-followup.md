## Follow-up Message Options

### Version 1: Direct Report Offer (RECOMMENDED)

Hi {FirstName}, thanks for connecting.

I just finished a report on prediction market data that most funds don't know exists. It shows how funds are using real-time probability data to front-run Fed decisions by 48 hours.

The report covers:
- How to extract structured data from prediction markets
- Converting probabilities to tradeable signals
- Integration with traditional data sources

We've helped 3 mid-market funds build prediction market pipelines. Want the report? Just say yes and I'll send it over - no pitch, just insights.

### Version 2: Use Case Focus

Hi {FirstName}, thanks for connecting.

Quick question: Are you exploring alternative data sources to compete with larger funds?

I have a free report showing how prediction market data can provide a proprietary edge without massive infrastructure investment. One fund we worked with saw 12% alpha vs. S&P in 2024 using these signals.

Want it? Just reply and I'll send it over.
