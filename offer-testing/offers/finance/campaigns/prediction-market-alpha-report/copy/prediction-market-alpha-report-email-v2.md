**Subject: How funds front-ran Fed decisions by 48 hours**

Hi {FirstName},

While Citadel and Two Sigma run LLMs on earnings calls, most mid-market funds are still reading transcripts manually.

But there's another data source most funds don't know about: prediction markets.

**Here's what we've seen:**
- Funds using prediction market data front-ran Fed decisions by 48 hours
- One fund saw 12% alpha vs. S&P in 2024 using prediction market signals
- The data is real-time, structured, and integrates with existing research workflows

I just finished a report called "The Prediction Market Alpha Report" that shows:
- How to extract structured data from prediction markets
- Converting probabilities to tradeable signals
- Integration strategies with traditional data sources
- Real examples from funds we've worked with

We've helped 3 mid-market funds ($50M-$200M AUM) build prediction market data pipelines. The report shares what we learned.

Want it? Just reply and I'll send it over - no pitch, just insights.

Best,
{YourName}

Hi {FirstName},

Following up on the prediction market report.

Quick question: Are you exploring alternative data sources to compete with larger funds? The report shows how prediction markets can provide a proprietary edge without massive infrastructure investment.

Still interested? Just reply and I'll send it over.

Best,
