## Connection Request Options

### Version 1: Direct Offer (RECOMMENDED)

Hi {FirstName}, I noticed {FundName} is building out research capabilities. I just finished a report on how funds are using prediction market data to front-run Fed decisions by 48 hours. Happy to share if useful.

### Version 2: Signal Reference

Hi {FirstName}, I saw {FundName} is hiring research analysts. I have a free report on prediction market data that most funds don't know exists - shows how to extract real-time probability signals. Interested?

### Version 3: Competitive Angle

Hi {FirstName}, While Citadel uses AI on earnings calls, most mid-market funds are missing prediction market data. I have a free report showing how funds front-ran Fed decisions by 48 hours. Want it?
