## Email Body

**Subject: Small funds are ignoring a $3B+ prediction market**

Hi {FirstName},

Most small-to-mid funds are missing a massive opportunity: a $3B+ prediction market providing real-time probability data on events that move markets.

While you're reading Fed transcripts and earnings reports after the fact, prediction markets are showing probability shifts 48 hours before major announcements.

**The opportunity:**
- Real-time probability data on Fed decisions, earnings surprises, economic indicators
- Structured data you can integrate with your existing research process
- A proprietary edge that most funds don't even know exists

I just finished a report on how funds are using prediction market data to generate alpha. It covers:
- How to extract structured data from prediction markets
- Converting probabilities to tradeable signals
- Integration strategies with traditional data sources
- Real examples of funds front-running Fed decisions by 48 hours

Want the report? Just reply and I'll send it over - no pitch, just insights.

Best,
{YourName}

Hi {FirstName},

Following up on my note about prediction market data. 

The report shows how 3 mid-market funds ($50M-$200M AUM) built prediction market data pipelines and used them to front-run Fed decisions by 48 hours.

Still interested? Just reply and I'll send it over.
