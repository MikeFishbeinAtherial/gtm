## Problem → Symptom → Signal Chain

### Problem Statement
Hedge funds and PE firms need AI-powered research capabilities and proprietary data sources to compete with mega-funds, but can't afford Citadel-scale AI teams. They're missing opportunities because they don't have access to alternative data sources like prediction markets.

### Symptoms (What companies with this problem would be doing)

| Symptom Type | They Would Be... |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Hiring** | Hiring research analysts, quantitative researchers, data scientists |
| **Using/Buying** | Investing in data platforms, research tools, alternative data sources |
| **Saying/Posting** | Mentioning AI/ML initiatives, competitive challenges, need for proprietary edge |
| **Experiencing (events)** | LP meetings where they need to demonstrate innovation, competitive pressure |
| **Lacking/Missing** | No dedicated AI/ML team, limited alternative data sources, manual research processes |

## Notes

- **Focus on hedge funds first:** Prediction markets are more relevant for trading/investment decisions
- **PE firms secondary:** May be less relevant unless they're doing public market investing
- **Non-technical buyers:** CIO/Head of Research are decision makers, not technical implementers - keep messaging accessible
- **Timing matters:** Job postings in last 30 days = active hiring = immediate need
