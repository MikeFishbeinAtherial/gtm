Mr. Seides co-founded Capital Allocators Summits with Rahul Moodgal, a friend and industry veteran, to bring together industry leaders for connection and learning. He developed Capital Allocators University to teach senior professionals non-investment disciplines that are essential to investment success. He also advises managers on business strategy and allocators on investment strategy. In March 2021, he published his second book, Capital Allocators: How the World's Elite Money Managers Lead and Invest, which distills key lessons from the first 150 episodes of the podcast. In October 2022, he was honored as Citizen of the Year at With Intelligence's inaugural Allocator Prizes. From 2002 to 2015, he was co-founder of Protégé Partners LLC and served as President and Co-Chief Investment Officer. Protégé was a leading multibillion-dollar alternative investment firm that invested in and seeded small hedge funds. In 2010, Larry Kochard and Cathleen Rittereiser profiled Ted in the book Top Hedge Fund Investors. In 2016, Ted authored his first book, So You Want to Start a Hedge Fund: Lessons for Managers and Allocators, to share lessons from his experience. He began his career from 1992-1997 under the tutelage of David Swensen at the Yale University Investments Office. During his five years at Yale, Ted focused on external public equity managers and internal fixed income portfolio management. Following business school, he spent two years investing directly in public and private equity at three of Yale's managers, Brahman Capital, Stonebridge Partners, and J.H. Whitney & Company. With aspirations to demonstrate the benefits of hedge funds on institutional portfolios to a broad audience, he made a non-profitable wager with Warren Buffett that pitted the 10-year performance of the S&P 500 against a selection of five hedge fund of funds from 2008 to 2017. He writes a blog called What Ted's Thinking and previously wrote columns for Institutional Investor, CFA Institute's Enterprising Investor, and the late Peter L. Bernstein's Economics and Portfolio Strategy. He is a member of the Advisory Council for the Alliance for Decision Education and a participant in the Hero's Journey Foundation. He previously served as Trustee and member of the investment committee at the Wenner-Gren Foundation, Trustee and head of the Programming Committee for the Greenwich Roundtable, and an Advisory Board member of Citizen Schools-New York. He graduated Cum Laude from Yale University and received an MBA from Harvard Business School.",
