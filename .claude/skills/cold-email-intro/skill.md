# Cold Email Intro Offer

Write short, conversational cold emails offering free value (reports, audits, lists, tools) to start conversations. Not product pitches.

## Description

Generate cold emails for intro offers - free assets given to prospects to start a conversation. Emails are under 100 words, 5 sentences max, with a casual tone and pattern-interrupt style. Goal: get them to request the free thing, not book a call.

## When to Use

- User wants to write "cold email" for an "intro offer" or "free offer"
- User asks to create emails for "lead magnets" or "free reports/audits/lists"
- User wants "short cold emails" that offer free value
- User mentions writing "pattern interrupt" or "conversational" cold emails
- User references giving "permissionless value" via email

## Prerequisites

- Know what free offer is being given (report, list, audit, tool, etc.)
- Know the target audience (role, industry)
- Know the problem being solved
- Have social proof if available (company name + outcome)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Gather Context

Ask for (if not provided):
1. **Free offer**: What asset are you giving away? (report, list, audit, tool)
2. **Target**: Who receives this? (role, industry, company size)
3. **Problem**: What pain does this solve?
4. **Social proof**: Any company + outcome example?
5. **Sender name**: Who signs the email?

### Step 2: Generate Subject Lines

Create 3 subject line options:

**Rules:**
- 1-3 words max
- Reference the core problem
- Mystery > clarity
- Never "Quick question"

**Examples:**
- "attribution drag"
- "unused licenses"
- "hiring signal"
- "your ICP"
- "competitor intel"

### Step 3: Generate Email (5 Sentences Max)

Structure each email with exactly 5 components:

**1. Opening Hook (1 sentence)**
Problem observation or provocative question. No greeting fluff.
- No "Hope this email finds you well"
- No "I noticed you..."
- Jump straight into their problem

**2. Problem Context (1-2 sentences)**
Quantify the pain with specific percentages or numbers.
- "30-40% of SaaS spend is hiding in tools..."
- "Most marketing leaders can't show ROI..."

**3. Social Proof (1 sentence)**
Company name + specific outcome with numbers.
- "Netflix used [tool] to cut 600 apps to 400, saving seven figures."

**4. The Offer (1 sentence)**
Concrete deliverable they can visualize.
- Not "insights" or "tips" - actual assets
- Free, no strings attached

**5. Easy CTA + Detach (1 sentence)**
Simple ask with an out.
- "Want it? Just reply."
- "Interested? I'll send it over. No worries if timing's off."

### Step 4: Apply Style Rules

**DO:**
- Casual words: "ya'll", "you guys", "wanna"
- Light cursing if appropriate: "damn", "hell"
- Short, punchy sentences
- Make them feel FOMO, curiosity, or mild anxiety

**DON'T:**
- AI-sounding phrases
- Over-personalize with irrelevant details
- Emoji (unless they use them)
- Tracking pixels or links in first email
- More than 5 sentences
- Corporate speak

### Step 5: Generate Follow-up

Create ONE follow-up for non-responders (2-3 days later):

```
circling back.

[restate the offer in different words]

still around if you want it.
```

### Step 6: Output Format

```markdown
## Subject Line Options
1. [subject 1]
2. [subject 2]
3. [subject 3]

## Email Variant A
{first_name},

[opening hook]

## Full Examples

### Example: Hiring Intelligence List

**Subject:** hiring signal

```
sarah,

how are you sourcing senior engineers right now?

most recruiters charge $20K per hire but 40% of qualified candidates are already engaging with your competitors on linkedin.

stripe found their last 3 infrastructure leads using competitor intel.

i built a list of every senior engineer who's been active on your top 3 competitors' posts in the past 60 days. includes their linkedin, current company, and engagement level.

want it? just reply.

### Example: Attribution Report

**Subject:** attribution drag

```
kim,

how are you showing marketing roi in quarterly reviews?

30-40% of revenue gets misattributed because most tools can't track dark social or word-of-mouth properly.

sendgrid used proper attribution modeling to prove marketing drove 60% more pipeline than finance thought.

i can send you a breakdown of where your attribution is probably breaking and what it's costing you.

interested? i'll email it over. no worries if timing's off.

## Personalization Guidelines

**Use sparingly:**
- Recent job change
- Recent company news
- Specific tech stack
- Hiring signals

**Never use:**
- College attended
- Generic company facts
- "I noticed your post about..."
- Their birthday

**Best personalization:**
Reference their actual problem based on role, industry, recent hires, or tech they use.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Too long**: If you need to scroll, it's too long
2. **Too formal**: "I hope this message finds you well" = delete
3. **Vague offer**: "insights" and "tips" = not concrete enough
4. **Asking for a call**: Give free value, don't book meetings
5. **No social proof**: Always include one real example
6. **Weak problem framing**: Use specific numbers and percentages
7. **Multiple asks**: One clear action only

## What This Works For

**Perfect for:**
- Reports, Lists, Audits, Tools, Data, Templates, Frameworks

**Not for:**
- Direct service pitches
- Product demos

- Partnerships

## Success Metrics

- 20-40% open rate
